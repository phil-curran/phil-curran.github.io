          <em>As you wander you'll notice some facts: that Cité U</em> is the largest concentration of residence halls in Paris and the Ile-de-France region—some 5,800 beds in 40 residences—boasting a diverse range of facilities and services for both the
          students and researchers who stay, as well as the general public and even tourists. We'll lean over to also point out to you that both historically and at the present moment,
          <em>Cité U</em> provides services for students and researchers from
          <em>outside</em> of France, though some French students from regions outside of Paris have and continue to be welcomed.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>"So what?" you might say. "Ah," we say. Did you also notice that the students are grouped by nations, and live and study as if in some kind of 'United Nations' university style? And, in fact, we add,
          <em>Cité U</em> could be considered to be a product of a previous era, one that is more reflective of an
          <em>inter-national</em> imagination and framework, which reflects the very strong dominance of nation-state thinking. At this point we would encourage you to open the <a href="http://www.ciup.fr/en/houses/" target="_blank">link to the home pages</a>          for all of these residences, as well as the map above, to get a strong sense of the nations and regions present, and what it was that motivated this project. </p>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">In the aftermath of the First World War the International University Campus in Paris was born of the dreams and desires of exceptional men.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">In the pacifist mood of the inter-war years André HONNORAT, Minister of Education conceived the idea of creating a "campus" intended to house foreign students and thus to contribute to the construction of peace in the world in a place dedicated
          to international exchanges, where the youth of the world would learn to live together.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Thanks to the support given in the early days of the project by the industrialist, Émile DEUTSCH DE LA MEURTHE and Paul APPELL, the Rector of the Paris Academy and the President of the Council of the University of Paris, the Utopian dream became
          a reality in 1925.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Nearly 100 years on from
      <em>Cité U</em>'s establishment, it is worth reflecting on what has changed, and why, in the organization of the university and university life, and what has continued, though perhaps in a somewhat different form. </p>
    <p>Perhaps
      <em>Cité U</em>'s interest in promoting inter-cultural dialogue is a precursor to the contemporary emphasis on
      <em>inter-cultural or</em>
      <em>global competencies, </em>and
      <em> global learning, that</em> we hear so much about these days in higher education circles. Do we mean the same things, despite using similar terms, or do we mean something rather different today by global competence and intercultural dialogue. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>What about language? Today acquiring English is a key reason for many students wanting to study abroad.&nbsp; By way of contrast,
      <em>Cité U in the 1920s and 30s </em>was a place to focus on learning French, and learning about France, via the 'world city' (as the urbanist <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PGHAL68" target="_blank">Peter Hall</a> deemed it)
      of Paris. </p>
    <p>You might reflect on the symbolism and the materialization of the nation – the national – in this built form. &nbsp;In our tour through
      <em>Cité U</em> we will find ourselves near the facades of the central meeting space (the <a href="http://www.ciup.fr/maison-internationale/" target="_blank">Maison Internationale</a>, financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr.), </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">...and the "houses" that were designed (primarily between 1923 and 1969) to theoretically reflect national cultures. Many of the architects (e.g., Le Corbusier) were national heroes with international stature. This is thus a higher education landscape
      deftly designed to communicate and be
      <em>read</em>. It reflects a diversity of conceptual currents that were prominent at the time, including the notion of culture as trait (versus process), colonial visions and postcolonial adjustments, and especially the international modern movement
      (which is captured very well in the <a href="http://www.ciup.fr/maison-du-bresil/" target="_blank">Brazilian</a> and <a href="http://www.ciup.fr/fondation-suisse/" target="_blank">Swiss</a> houses). Each house also has a distinct and evolving history,
      for the ongoing operation of national or regional houses often reflected national crises, including wars, genocide, revolutions (e.g., Iran), decolonization and independence, and so on. </p>
    <p>In 2008 we (Kris and Susan) took this walk with colleagues after a <a href="http://www.sciencespo.fr/" target="_blank">Sciences Po</a> workshop on the European Higher Education Area and made similar kinds of observations about the then and now of
      higher education. But what struck us as profoundly important as we chatted was that
      <em>Cité U</em> was, in 1925, also decades
      <em>ahead</em> of most current thinking about the handling of mobile foreign students and scholars.&nbsp; How come, you might ask? </p>
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="media">
        <div class="media-body">
          <img class="media-object pull-left" src="../../_img/number-01.png" alt="one">
          <p>Well for one thing,
            <em>Cité U</em> is a product of a higher education era where the philanthropists and industrialists were vigorously active and far-sighted, more concerned with encouraging enlightened thinking and substantive change than their own personal wealth
            and its disbursal under the right tax conditions (ideally with a naming rights/branding rider). </p>
          <p>With considerable foresight, political and business elites established what has been deemed a "private foundation of public utility". Yet nearly 90 years later in the European Union, most member states and numerous stakeholder organizations
            are facing huge challenges trying to cultivate <a href="http://www.efc.be/projects/eu/efprf/" target="_blank">philanthropy</a> in higher education, dominated as it is by governments, though with some funding coming from the supra-national
            EU level. Perhaps you might try this real world thought experiment: can you point to a new
            <em>higher ed space</em> of this scale anywhere in the world (let alone Europe), which is the product of "industrialists, bankers and foreign foundations", in partnership with multiple levels of government? </p>
          <img class="media-object pull-left" src="../../_img/number-02.png" alt="two">
          <p>Second, despite challenges associated with housing foreign exchange students in a designated space (on a campus, within residences), spaces like
            <em>Cité U</em> reflect the production of a service space, a space for knowledge production, and a space for the formation of social relations that is
            <em>not associated with any one university</em>, while also being designed to ground mobile exchange students in a different territory for lengthy periods of time. Imagine multiple universities coordinating the creation of such a space in a city-region
            like Amsterdam, London, Shanghai, Rabat, Sydney, Sao Paolo, or Toronto, though in a manner that also folds in more students from the host country. It's hard to imagine such cooperation occurring! Perhaps we're just too critical. Or perhaps
            you might be able to provide us with some good examples we are not aware of. </p>
          <img class="media-object pull-left" src="../../_img/number-03.png" alt="three">
          <p>Third,
            <em>Cité U</em> was, and is, a form of higher education for city-region development (the focus of next week's material), though via an initiative framed not just in the 1920s, or in relation to the war which had preceded it, but in an effort to
            <em>provide for the city</em>. The campus helped facilitate the development of this zone in Paris's 14th arrondisement, and it still matters, a lot. This partly explains why the <a href="http://www.iledefrance.fr/" target="_blank">Region Ile-de-France</a>            has played such an important role in the substantial and ongoing process of renovation that has been underway for over a decade. For instance, there are <a href="http://www.paris.fr/pratique/vie-etudiante/maison-des-initiatives-etudiantes/10-nouvelles-maisons-pour-la-cite-universitaire-internationale/rub_5327_actu_128645_port_24091"
            target="_blank">plans in place</a> to develop 10 new residences on the campus for some 1,800 visitors. </p>

      <p>Before we leave the fascinating space of
        <em>Cité U</em>, we'd like to invite you to step back in time for a moment to get a sense of what it felt like to live in this space. Take a look at this evocative short film of the memories and social life of a former student (Sarah, now living in
        Tel Aviv) that are triggered and intensely felt when she visits her old Cité U room. The short film also profiles Juan, who is going through similar and different life transforming experiences, in Sarah's old room.</p>
      <p>We can't speak for you, but our view is that this stirring film reminds us that whilst on the one hand higher education fuels the development of society and economy, on the other hand it also
        <em>transforms</em> lives. In other words, higher education plays a significant role in the nurturing of people and the construction of (world) citizenship and subjectivity. It can enhance understandings of the meanings of life, and help develop social
        skills to navigate the ups and downs of life's complex pathways. </p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="sectionheading">But times change...in important ways</h3>
    <p>As we wandered through
      <em>Cité U</em>, however, our conversation inevitably moved toward the 'now', and what had changed in big and important ways. As we came together more recently to plan this MOOC, we listed the changes that distinguish this earlier period from the new
      'global' era that is transforming the sector. We see, for example: </p>
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <ul>
          <li>Major
            <em>demographic change</em> with a much larger world population (approx. two billion in 1925 vs. seven billion in 2013).</li>
          <li>The
            <em>development and restructuring of economies</em> (local/national/regional/global) with the emergence of regional and global knowledge economies much more dependent upon highly skilled (quaternary sector) labor as well as research and development
            (R&amp;D).
          </li>
          <li>The emergence of the
            <em>global urban era</em>, such that more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas. Global cities have come to play a key role in acting as the interconnected nodes (ie command and control centers) of the global economy, while
            at the same time we've seen huge mega-cities emerge, especially in the Global South, and global suburbanization more generally in the Global North and the Global South.</li>
          <li>The
            <em>end of colonialism</em>, and the beginning and then
            <em>end of the Cold War</em> such that the ideological fractures that once inhibited human mobility across space have been significantly reduced (though not completely).</li>
          <li>The emergence of
            <em>intergovernmental organizations</em> (e.g., UNESCO, the OECD, the EU) with significant higher education and research mandates.</li>
          <li>
            <em>Massification</em> - the structural transformation of higher education so larger and larger proportions of society attend, and expect to attend, colleges and universities.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="span6">
        <ul>
          <li>Major
            <em>technological transformations</em>, including a variety of technologies that enable higher education systems and the people that make it up to connect, to forge and maintain weak and strong ties, and to compare.</li>
          <li>The
            <em>enhanced influence of market-oriented ideologies</em> (which some analysts have deemed neoliberalism), which have enabled the emergence of austerity agendas that drive down the proportion of revenue coming from the state, and opened up the
            higher education sector to managerial approaches (sometimes deemed 'corporatization')</li>
          <li>The emergence of
            <em>English as lingua franca</em> in higher education and research circles, especially at the (post)graduate level. </li>
          <li>The emergence of
            <em>global audit culture</em>; a broad systemic cultural shift that reflects an uneasy but grudging willingness to compare and be compared, to rank and be ranked. </li>
          <li>The
            <em>emergence of new private sector players</em>,
            <em>public-private partnerships, and public-sector spin-offs</em>. Some of these new players provide higher education services so as to extract profit from the sector, while others seek to serve various stakeholders (both public and private) via
            consultancies, the media, strategic advice, learning management systems, MOOC platforms, and so on.</li>

        <p>But perhaps what unites us all is a concern with this big, big question: how have universities responded to these major structural transformations, especially over the last 5-10 years? And more precisely,
          <em>how and why have universities approached the 'internationalization' process in this new structural context?</em> Have they maintained the objectives that drove the development of <a href="http://www.ciup.fr/" target="_blank">La Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris</a>?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="well well-large pull-right" style="max-width:40%;">
      <p class="box-title muted">Box 1 – Internationalisation vs Globalization.</p>
      <p>Note that we use the term 'internationalisation' here, much as universities do, to talk about their outward reaching strategies. Since the 1980s, however, the term 'globalization' has also been invoked to talk about the broad structural transformations
        facing all societies around the world, from Iceland to Djibouti, from Singapore to Saudi Arabia. It is worth contemplating the differences between the terms. For example, <a href="http://www.madeleinefgreen.org/" target="_blank">Madeleine Green</a>        <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/globalhighered/global-citizenship-%E2%80%93-what-are-we-talking-about-and-why-does-it-matter" target="_blank">notes</a> that international in higher ed circles implies "between and among nations," while
        "global denotes transcending national borders." And <a href="http://www.geography.wisc.edu/faculty/profile.php?p=32" target="_blank">Keith Woodward</a>, a geographer at UW-Madison, suggested to us that "internationalization concerns changes at
        a specific territorial 'scale' - the movement of processes beyond the spatial limit of the nation-state - whereas globalization enrolls processes of
        <em>multiple</em> spatialities/'scales' in a globalizing/world-wide relation." We don't want to get too fixated on the differences as it might put you to sleep, but do suggest that you reflect on what work each of these terms is being asked to do,
        by whom, and in what contexts.</p>
    </div>
    <p>How will we engage with the big question that we posed above for this MOOC? We'll certainly be drawing upon academic and policy literatures, as well as our own experiences and networks. But we also intend to draw upon our own research over the past
      decade that has engaged a wide array of people, associations, and organizations either studying and/or constructing this new global higher education landscape. It's been our experience that you can't approach a phenomenon like the globalization
      of higher education and research without being immersed in this world so as to see the wide array of practices, technologies, personalities, ideologies, regulations, and power politics at work. And while there are imposing structural transformations
      underway, important principled and unprincipled decisions are being made, every minute of every day. The global higher education landscape is being (in many instances quite radically) constructed and transformed. We are all complicit, it is important
      to realize, in this development process. </p>
    <p>This said, we are not able to, nor are we interested in, presenting this MOOC as
      <em>the</em> all-encompassing 'complete' and universal perspective on what is happening. &nbsp;Our understandings are necessarily partial and situated. &nbsp;For this reason we have tried to bring in a range of 'experts' via podcasts and hyper-links,
      as well as using the MOOC format to 'crowd-source' knowledge and expertise. We therefore encourage you to develop your own views, and to critique ours, so that this MOOC really becomes a Massive Open Online Resource (MOOR)—a resource for all that
      reflects
      <em>your</em> voice and, in aggregate, a myriad of perspectives unearthing new issues and ways forward.</p>
    <h3>
      <strong>A Vocabulary for Making Sense of the Emerging Global Higher Ed Landscape from a University Perspective</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>We love to read. Each of us—well, especially Susan (!)—has a large collection of books, and hard drives chock-a-block full of PDFs on all the themes being dealt within this MOOR. We also love bookstores, real bookstores like Garrison Keillor's
      <a href="http://www.commongoodbooks.com/" target="_blank">Common Good Books</a> in St. Paul, Minnesota, where you can feel and smell the books on the tables and talk to knowledgeable booksellers.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>But we have also come to the very strong view that getting a sense of how (and by whom) the sector is being transformed, before our very eyes, requires us to get in there and talk to the framers, shapers and players.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Given the topic of Week 1 – of the how universities are making sense of big global changes and in some cases creatively developing new models for engagementwe thought you might want to meet one of those &nbsp;players - &nbsp;<a href="http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/ghawawini/"
      target="_blank">Gabriel Hawawini</a>, Professor of Finance and former Dean of <a href="http://www.insead.edu/home/" target="_blank">INSEAD</a> (2000-2006). </p>
    <p>INSEAD is a leading business school that trains up not just people destined for the business world, but also people who work in the non-profit and public-sector worlds. Gabriel is a very informed thinker about the globalization of higher education
      and research, as well as a member of the Board of Trustees of this highly innovative and new initiative, the <a href="http://www.uopeople.org/" target="_blank">University of the People</a>. He kindly offered to respond to a series of questions we
      posed to him via Skype for this week's class. As you listen to his responses here, and read his SSRN working paper titled
      <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1954697" target="_blank">
        <em>The Internationalization of Higher Education Institutions: A Critical Review and a Radical Proposal</em>
      </a> (November 2011), you will note him reflecting on the challenges facing the contemporary university today. </p>
      
<div class="well pull-left soundcloud" style="margin: 0px 30px 10px 0px; width:60%;">
<p><a href="http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/ghawawini/" target="_blank">Gabriel Hawawini</a> was integrally involved in the rethinking that led INSEAD to extract itself out of its (perhaps too) comfortable nest in Fontainebleau,
France (near Paris), by asking new questions about its mission/vision, the suite of options to be pursued to realize a new set of objectives, and what mechanisms and modes of engagement should be utilized to bring their adopted model to life.
We will hear more about this issue from Gabriel and others in Week 7 (Singapore).</p>

    <p>Gabriel's comments, and especially his working paper, point to a number of factors and dynamics, which we also see at work. But he is not the only shaper with interesting things to say. Take a look at these two complementary readings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/comprehending-international-initiatives-universities-taxonomy-modes-engagement-and" target="_blank">
          <em>Comprehending The International Initiatives of Universities:</em>
          <em> A Taxonomy of Modes of Engagement and Institutional Logics</em>
        </a> by Richard J. Edelstein and John Aubrey Douglass (University of California, Berkeley, December 2012). </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/Resource_Library_Assets/Publications_Library/Comprehensive_Internationalization__From_Concept_to_Action/" target="_blank">
          <em>Comprehensive Internationalization: From Concept to Action</em>
        </a> by John Hudzik (NAFSA, 2011).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each distills decades of previous research and proselytizing on internationalization by influential scholars like <a href="http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/cidec/Faculty/Adjunct_Faculty.html" target="_blank">Jane Knight</a> (University of Toronto), and
      many others.</p>
    <p>Our take on things is that in this current 'global' era in which universities find themselves, we are witnessing the emergence of: (i) new
      <em>logics</em>; (ii) new
      <em>models </em>to organize and communicate internationalization processes, and (iii) new
      <em>mechanisms and practices</em>, all of which are reshaping the nature of universities, their associated global footprints, the sectors in which they operate, and the relationship between the sector and economic growth more generally. </p>
    <p>These developments not only involve a raft of new actors in the sector, but these actors operate on scales, such as the global and the regional, which are increasingly more important and powerful in framing and shaping agendas for universities, academics,
      students and administrators. We'll be developing these different scales as we move through the course, exploring the ways in which these scales are unhinging the hold of the national on determining the dynamics of the higher education sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Indeed it is next to impossible to keep up with the swirl of activities and new developments that have been unleashed as a result of more global processes at work. In February 2014, for instance, Facebook <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/808/SocialEDU"
      target="_blank">announced</a> it was creating a pilot project in Rwanda, along with the Boston-based MOOC platform <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a>, the Government of Rwanda, Nokia, and Airtel Africa, "to develop a plan to
      provide students with free, high-quality, localized educational content and create a social learning experience that is accessible via handheld devices." Facebook <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/808/SocialEDU" target="_blank">puts it this way</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>With SocialEDU, students in Rwanda will receive free data plans for accessing free edX MOOCs from some of the world's leading universities, including Harvard, MIT, U.C. Berkeley, TU Delft, Australian National University and ETH Zurich. Our platform
        will allow students to ask questions, engage with other students, interact with teachers, and participate in group discussions. We are bringing the classroom to them and providing locally-relevant content, while transforming the educational experience
        to provide collaborative, social and sustainable learning.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Interestingly, one week later Facebook let it slip that it was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/03/facebook-in-talks-to-acquire-drone-maker-titan-aerospace/" target="_blank">looking into buying drone maker Titan Aerospace</a>, presumably so
      it could "blanket" Rwanda and other parts of Africa without Internet access via <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmN13LnBk3c" target="_blank">solar powered drones</a> that can stay aloft for up to five
      <em>years</em>. As an aside, we're curious if the universities mentioned above know about this new initiative, or if the intermediaries they are now tied to (edX and Facebook) are acting
      <em>on their behalf</em> in Rwanda. Interesting times indeed, raising lots of questions, speculations, implications and complications. </p>
    <p>So
      <em>yes</em>, we're still welcoming foreign students to campuses much as
      <em>Cité U</em> did in the 1920s. And
      <em>yes</em>, there is huge variability when you compare higher education institutions with each other. But the structural forces we outlined above and which we will be unpacking over the next few weeks have led to an explosion of activities, agendas,
      partnerships, and global footprints which demand what noted public intellectual <a href="http://www.boaventuradesousasantos.pt/pages/en/articles.php" target="_blank">Boaventura de Sousa Santos</a> describes as <a href="http://www.boaventuradesousasantos.pt/media/University%20at%20crossroads_HumanArchitecture2011.pdf"
      target="_blank">'strong questions with strong answers'</a>. &nbsp;So let's get started. </p>
    <div class="arrow sectionheader" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <div class="arrow_body" style="width:410px">
        <h2>Logics, Models, and Mechanisms</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="arrowhead"></div>
    </div>
    <p>Unpacking complex phenomena so that we can see what is going on, so that we can see the wood for the trees, is no easy or indeed straightforward process. What dynamics should we focus on? What processes should we follow so as to reveal what is at
      work? We tossed around possible entry points to this first week, and finally decided to proceed by identifying, tracing out, and exploring the consequences of the dominant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logics </li>
      <li>Models, and </li>
      <li>Mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...at work in the transforming of higher education sectors around the world. </p>
    <p>So how might we employ these? Take, for example, the creation of
      <em>Cité U. We could argue it</em> reflected a desire (a
      <em>vision or logic</em>) to <a href="http://www.ciup.fr/en/home/history-and-philosophy-26595/" target="_blank">create</a> a "school of human relations for peace," one that would "bring students together and act as a catalyst for the Universalist values
      of peace and solidarity." The higher education
      <em>model</em> to realize this vision involved drawing students from around the world to Paris, France (importing them, in a sense). The primary
      <em>mechanism</em> to enable this to occur was the multi-residence campus: a built form designed to materially and symbolically support this vision and logic.
      <em>Cité U</em> is thus a multi-national service campus—it is connected to and supports other universities in Paris by providing a nurturing residential space for the international students (and researchers) who are affiliated with other universities
      in the city. </p>
    <p>Thus we see a logic &gt; adopted model &gt; primary mechanism relationship at play.</p>
    <p>We like this analytical approach because it helps us see processes at work. Like many of you, we see a complex assembling of elements and dynamics in play, including issues, initiatives, agendas, actors, forces, outcomes, technologies, and so on,
      that are re shaping universities. But, for learning purposes, we're going to invert the order to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanisms </li>
      <li>Models </li>
      <li>Logics </li>
    </ul>

          <em>Comprehending The International Initiatives of Universities:</em>
          <em> A Taxonomy of Modes of Engagement and Institutional Logics</em>
        </a> by Richard J. Edelstein and John Aubrey Douglass (University of California, Berkeley, December 2012). </p>
    </div>
    <p>Think about the wide array of mechanisms used to entangle universities with universities, and with the societies and economies in which their partner universities are embedded. We hear, for example, about international collaborative degrees (dual
      and joint degrees), study abroad, branch campuses, MOOCs, joint advising, joint programs, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), joint publishing across institutions, and so on. The list goes on and on. </p>
    <p>Now take a pen or pencil out and list the wide variety of ways the university you know best is reaching out across global space and creating the mechanisms to create weak and strong ties. </p>
    <p>Once you've done this, look at the list and try to create categories to bundle these mechanisms.</p>
    <p>How did it go? We're not sure how you felt about this exercise, but creating categories is a difficult thing to do, and depends on what criteria you emphasize. Richard J. Edelstein and John Aubrey Douglass from the Berkeley Centre for Studies of Higher
      Education (CSHE) have provided us with one example. In their <a href="http://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/comprehending-international-initiatives-universities-taxonomy-modes-engagement-and" target="_blank">working paper</a> (we also provided the
      link above), they created what they deem "modes of engagement" [mechanisms, in our terms], and then bundled them into seven clusters. </p>
    <p>This is quite the comprehensive list and for sure they have not identified
      <em> all </em>of the possible mechanisms at work. For example, where might the idea of a critical mass of researchers in one university working on global challenges, such as climate change, be placed? In which cluster might you note a university legitimizing
      and indirectly supporting world university rankings agendas? &nbsp;Following one model of clustering might result in us missing important developments. For instance, we'll be grappling with the issues of global challenges and rankings in Week 6
      (World Class) and Week 7 (Singapore) as they are big on university agendas. </p>
    <p>Clearly, any one of these mechanisms (or modes of engagement) could have a book or course devoted to it, which might range over questions like: what does it mean? What forms do they take? What new interests are being advanced? What other practices
      are now dropping off the agenda?, and so on. </p>
    <p>Now take just one of the
      <em>modes of engagement </em>identified by Edelstein and Douglass above, that of "cross-cultural communication and inter-cultural competence," or what others term "global competency" or "global learning".&nbsp; The 'global competency' agenda is one
      that higher education providers and employers (be they in the private, public, or non-profit sectors) in many countries are deeply engaged with at the moment. Why has it arisen now? Who is promoting this agenda? What does it mean? How does it intersect
      with, and diverge from, the agenda underlying the creation of
      <em>Cité U</em> and why? Listen, for example, to this array of definitions of global competency we collected to give you some food for thought. </p>

    <p>You will quickly come to see that in all of these areas referred to by Edelstein and Douglass, including the idea of global competencies, there is an unresolved debate about what they mean, how they are measured, and how to cultivate them (i.e. can
      anyone ever be
      <em>globally</em> competent?).</p>

      <em>Now ask yourself the following questions:</em> What, if any, commonalities are there across the suite of definitions? If so, what are they? Were there major differences? And what do
      <em>you</em> think 'global competency' means, if anything at all? Who, if anyone, is pushing this agenda forward in your institution, or higher education sector, and why? Finally, how do you effectively measure or evaluate what 'global competency' and
      'global learning' is? </p>
    <p>And if, as Madeleine notes in her podcast, and in
      <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/improving_assessing.pdf" target="_blank">
        <em>Improving and Assessing Global Learning</em>
      </a> (NAFSA, 2013), the main effort to support the internationalization and global learning agenda happens at the curricular level within universities and colleges, especially since the majority of the world's students cannot take advantage of study
      or research opportunities abroad, should we be focused more on internationalizing the curriculum and the faculty base, instead of relying on high-profile but often costly initiatives 'abroad' like an office in Shanghai or London? In other words,
      could we rethink mobility and global competencies by building into classroom learning experiences new practices that some people deem 'internationalizing at home'. See one example of such a curricular-oriented agenda <a href="http://ip.cals.wisc.edu/for-faculty-staff/internationalizing-curriculum/science-internationalization-events-resources/"
      target="_blank">here</a> at UW-Madison. We don't have
      <em>the</em> answers to these questions, but they're worth thinking about and debating. </p>
    <p>What we'd like to flag here is that, in comparison to the era when Cité U was established, the breadth and depth of mechanisms to entangle have expanded significantly. To us this is not just the result of globalization, but is globalization itself.
      Yet imagining (such as the idea of a 'world class university') is no guarantee of action, for it is dependent upon university leaders and regulators encouraging and enabling actions, with actions also dependent upon those faculty, staff, and students
      who have the resources and inclination to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to them. Nevertheless, compared to five decades ago, there really is a lot of opportunity for action out there.</p>
    <p>The expansive scale and scope of activities that bind together societies and economies via their higher education institutions is generating a lot of debate and new thinking. It also explains why we're seeing a range of interesting concepts emerge
      to finesse our discussions of internationalization, globalization, and so on. </p>
    <p>One such example is the idea of "comprehensive internationalization." <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/Find_Resources/Internationalizing_Higher_Education/NAFSA_Senior_Fellows_for_Internationalization/" target="_blank">NAFSA's John Hudzic</a> defines
      "
      <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/Resource_Library_Assets/Publications_Library/Comprehensive_Internationalization__From_Concept_to_Action/" target="_blank">comprehensive internationalization</a>" as:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>…a commitment, confirmed through action, to infuse international and comparative perspectives throughout the teaching, research, and service missions of higher education. It shapes institutional ethos and values and touches the entire higher education
        enterprise. It is essential that it be embraced by institutional leadership, governance, faculty, students, and all academic service and support units. It is an institutional imperative, not just a desirable possibility.</p>
      <p>Comprehensive internationalization not only impacts all of campus life but the institution's external frames of reference, partnerships, and relations. The global reconfiguration of economies, systems of trade, research, and communication, and the
        impact of global forces on local life, dramatically expand the need for comprehensive internationalization and the motivations and purposes driving it (2011, p. 6).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is a somewhat similar definition to that of the <a href="http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">American Council on Education</a>. For them, <a href="http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/2012-Mapping-Internationalization-on-U-S--Campuses.aspx"
      target="_blank">comprehensive internationalization is</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>…a strategic, coordinated process that seeks to align and integrate international policies, programs, and initiatives, and positions colleges and universities as more globally oriented and internationally connected" (2012, p. 3).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Interestingly, ACE bundles the suite of mechanisms we discussed above this way:</p>

        <br>Mapping internationalization on U.S. campuses. Washington, DC: ACE, p. 4.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now, the important point for you to remember is not that one approach is right and the other approach is wrong. Rather, it is to think about what it is that we then do in our institutions and beyond when we use these framings and mechanisms to guide
      interventions in our institutions and in the sector.</p>
    <h3>Models</h3>
    <p>Now let's move up a level of abstraction, and think beyond the blossoming of mechanisms and activities, to the emergence of new organizing models, and new institutional architectures and principles. &nbsp;Gabriel Hawawini hints at this with an expansive
      <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1954697" target="_blank">definition of internationalization</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>The internationalization of higher education institutions is the process of integrating the institution and its stakeholders</em>—
        <em>including its students, faculty, and staff</em>—
        <em>into a globalizing world.</em> This definition goes beyond the particular dimensions of teaching, research and service. It calls for a change in existing
        <em>structures</em> and
        <em>mindsets</em> in order to allow the institution to contribute to the shaping of the emerging global knowledge and learning network (2011, p.5; emphasis in original). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Did you detect that shift in focus, from thinking internally, to thinking externally, to basically turning the university inside out as an overriding objective? Malaysia's private <a href="http://www.limkokwing.net/" target="_blank">Limkokwing University of Creative Technology</a>,
      for example, has campuses in Gaborone (Botswana), Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Beijing (China), Masery (Lesotho) and London (UK). Did you also detect the relationship that gets drawn between processes taking place within the institution and an assumed
      relationship to multiple geographies in the world out there, i.e.
      <em>the global</em>?</p>
    <p>Now, we know that Gabriel Hawawini works for an elite business school, and is also associated with an institutional partnership between INSEAD and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. But what he's getting at here are
      <em>reconfiguring</em> options that appear to resonate with how almost all universities might internationalize, and especially in a manner that recognizes we inhabit a rapidly evolving world where it is increasingly undesirable to assume the world should
      only come to us, Cité U
      <strong>-</strong>style. </p>
    <p>Yet if we assume we should reach out and develop a more expansive global reach, what are the options and the models to think through what this might mean? One way of conceptualizing configuration options is graphically represented in Figure X, a model
      developed and then operationalized by senior leaders in INSEAD in relation to the development of their Asia campus in Singapore (est. 1999) and the <a href="http://about.insead.edu/partnerships/wharton_alliance.cfm" target="_blank">INSEAD-Wharton Alliance</a>      (est. 2001). We'll be developing these models as we move through the weeks, as they do help us see rather different processes and projects at work. For the moment we'll just sketch out their broad differences. </p>

        <p>The
          <strong>Import model </strong>you will recognize as the classic approach to internationalization, which has characterized most universities since their beginnings. University campuses establish formal and informal policies, programs and projects to
          draw in foreign degree students (at the undergraduate and graduate level) and foreign faculty. The level of internationalization is typically associated with measures of relative proportions of international/foreign students on campuses at any
          one time, or trends over time. This was and is the model that Cité Internationale is built upon, though as we noted, the campus was and is primarily a residential service space that supported students studying in other Paris-based universities.
          The vast majority of universities, even today, have adopted and work with this model.</p>

      <div class="span9">
        <p>The
          <strong>Export model</strong> is built on the assumption that core faculty of a university will be based at a central campus so as to retain critical mass, and enable the faculty to generate and disseminate knowledge via research and teaching practices.
          Knowledge is globalized via the export of courses that are taught by core faculty from the home location (as in the main campus). &nbsp;The Export model can be implemented via flying core faculty overseas to teach (a resource-intensive obligation,
          and a model that one of us (Susan) is involved with, as she teaches a University of Bristol program in Hong Kong). The problems associated with the Export model, with respect to teaching, can also be mediated via the use of distance-learning
          technologies (video conferencing and the internet). This model is often combined with hiring local or foreign lecturers to teach a significant proportion of course materials in leased or shared overseas offices, though often with uneven learning
          results.

      <div class="span9">
        <p>The
          <strong>Partnership model</strong> is an increasingly common mechanism to further the internationalization objectives of universities, especially in certain disciplines (e.g., Law) or in contexts where international collaboration is required by the
          state or other regulatory or funding authorities. The model is typically pursued via the exchange of students and faculty, via the joint operation of teaching and research programs, and via the provision of intellectual leadership or consultancy
          in the establishment or restructuring of research and teaching programs, departments, schools and indeed entire universities. A case in point here is the <a href="http://international.wisc.edu/nuproject/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison–Nazarbayev University Project</a>          to help establish a new School of Humanities and Social Sciences in Astana, Kazakhstan.</p>
        <p>The Partnership model is relatively low risk in nature from the perspective of both parties. Partnerships are established following negotiations between local and foreign universities, or else between foreign universities and the state. Equally
          important, partnerships with foreign universities enable local faculty to engage in a learning process with respect to program development, curriculum development, pedagogical practice, and research practice. They tend to be institutionalized
          in the form of time-specific MOUs and then more detailed legal agreements.</p>

        <p>The
          <strong>Network model</strong> is the least utilized of all of the globalization of higher education models in general, though it is increasingly evident in the cities of the Gulf, and East and Southeast Asia (as we will discover in Weeks 2 and 7).
          In this model, global networks are created via the merger of geographically separate institutions, or else the establishment of branch campuses in other countries. One of the key principles underlying the establishment of a genuine network of
          campuses is their functional integration with a relatively intense sharing of material and non-material resources, and a relatively flat hierarchy with respect to the quality of the multiple campuses and their respective roles in knowledge production.
          The Network model requires an undeniably significant commitment of up-front resources, and it is the most risky of all of the models outlined here. Once commitment is made to implement the Network model, flows of what might have been viewed
          as "proprietary knowledge" occur across space between the campuses, and presumably between the campuses and the firms based in campus city-regions.</p>
        <p>The Network model functions particularly well in global cities, as we will explore next week. Global cities are socio-economic formations that are built upon global flows of people, ideas, and technologies. Students and faculty regularly travel
          between campuses; indeed programs tend to be designed such that components are held in multiple locations. The nodal location also enables the university to leverage these flows.</p>

    <p>What's interesting about this series of models is the recognition that you can have differential power and quality assurance conditions when you set up branch campuses, an issue we focus attention on in Week 2 when we look at universities and branch
      campuses. Thus we can see, for example, branch campuses established in some countries (symbolized by the left half of the
      <strong>Foreign Campus Model</strong>) with faculty on different career paths than there are at the base campus, or nearly equivalent conditions for faculty and staff regardless of geographic location. In addition, this updated conceptualization recognizes
      the rising importance of partnerships, alliances, and consortia, an issue we have both studied (e.g., see '<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/globalhighered/international-consortia-universities-and-missionactivities-question" target="_blank">International Consortia of Universities and the Mission/Activities Question'</a>)
      as well as availed ourselves of (we met via a Worldwide Universities Network faculty mobility scheme a decade or so ago).</p>
    <br class="clearfix">
    <h3>Logics</h3>
    <p>Taken as a whole, it is clear that over the past two to three decades, universities have been faced with major structural and strategic challenges. These have resulted in significant transformations in the scope of their mission, governance, knowledge
      production and circulation, and relations with wider national, regional and global economies and societies. These transformations are part of a wider 'paradigmatic transition' facing all societies and universities, around the world, a point made
      eloquently by <a href="http://www.boaventuradesousasantos.pt/pages/en/homepage.php" target="_blank">Boaventura de SousaSantos</a> in his numerous works.</p>
    <p>It is in this context that we need to position the mechanisms and models outlined above. What needs to be asked is WHY: why are universities internationalizing in the ways they are? Why have these new models emerged at this point in time? And why
      are more and more universities seeking to use their internationalization mechanisms and models as branding devices?</p>
    <p>At one level, the answer might be an institutionally specific one. For example, see these two outlines of organizing logics, one by Edelstein and Aubrey Douglass, and one by Hawawini. </p>

    <p>
      <br>All of the objectives outlined above are indeed evident when you examine and assess the vast majority of universities' internationalization strategies. There are often differences with respect to the relative weight associated with the objectives,
      and these differences change over time and with leadership changes as well. Moreover, there are often significant intra-institutional differences; the logics of internationalization for a business school are often quite different than the logics
      of internationalization for college of arts and science.</p>
    <h3>But what about the logics driving bigger political projects?</h3>
    <p>But the institutional focus of Edelstein &amp; Aubrey Douglass and Hawawini's logics may, arguably, miss some of the bigger structuring sectoral and societal processes that are increasingly shaping the transformation of universities and their relationships
      to their societies and economies. As we move through the weeks you will begin to see these logics at work (at least this is our aspiration!), the ways in which universities strategize about these new rules of the game, and the new tensions and contradictions
      that are also set in train as a result. </p>
    <p>We've found it useful to think of these big dynamics as four systemically driven logics shaped by a strong underlying commitment to
      <em>global competition</em>.</p>
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p>
          <strong>Logic 1 - corporatisation</strong> is anchored in the New Public Management theory and was popularised by highly influential writers such as David Osborne and Ted Gaebler. New Public Management asks:
          <em>how can the values of business (competition, frugality, risk, choice, value for money, entrepreneurship) be used in the re/organisation of public services so as to enable those services to be delivered more efficiently and effectively? </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Logic 2 - 'comparative competitivism'</strong> is linked to the work of Harvard economist Michael Porter.
          <em>Comparative competitivism</em> asks:
          <em>what is it that we can produce (trade, or gain a greater market share in), where we have an existing or potential advantage in relation to our competitors</em>? One answer is that public sectors, like higher education, are increasingly viewed
          as potential 'service sectors' by Treasury and Trade Departments of governments, and as the revenue generators for a new services-based economy.&nbsp; </p>
      </div>
      <div class="span6">
        <p>
          <strong>Logic 3 - 'competitive comparison'</strong> asks:
          <em>how well does this unit (institution/city/nation/ region) do in relation to another</em>? This third logic uses hierarchical orderings, such as a ranking of 'world class' universities, to shape and determine the direction of improvement for
          universities, and is proving to be a highly influential shaper of universities and governments' engagements with the sector. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Logic 4 - 'cooperation' </strong>asks:
          <em>how might we</em> cooperate so as to manage the effects of competition and instability? This fourth logic is shaped by the view that being in a club (as opposed to being outside) will limit the negative consequences of wider economic, social
          and political volatility, whilst members can benefit from both size and shared resources. University consortia and regional integration strategies are examples here. Cooperation might also take the form of collaborative learning, including via
          MOOC platforms. Cooperation can generate a scaling dynamic, as was evident in the visualization we posted above of Coursera's global footprint.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Taken together, these logics do work
      <em>on</em> the sector. But they also produce contradictions and tensions – for instance through the ways in which competition and cooperation are at play.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they are not just abstract ideas. Rather, they are intended to capture something
      of the zeitgeist at work, and have real effects that go to the very core of what it is that a university is for in contemporary societies. </p>
    <p>And, as Drew Faust (President, Harvard University) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/books/review/Faust-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">put it in the <em>New York Times</em></a> on 1 September 2009 in the aftermath of the
      derivative-linked global financial crisis of 2007-2008:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Universities are meant to be producers not just of knowledge but also of (often inconvenient) doubt. They are creative and unruly places, homes to a polyphony of voices. But at this moment in our history, universities might well ask if they have
        in fact done enough to raise the deep and unsettling questions necessary to any society. </p>
      <p>As the world indulged in a bubble of false prosperity and excessive materialism, should universities—in their research, teaching and writing—have made greater efforts to expose the patterns of risk and denial? Should universities have presented
        a firmer counterweight to economic irresponsibility? Have universities become too captive to the immediate and worldly purposes they serve? Has the market model become the fundamental and defining identity of higher education?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These are questions with much gravity to them, and ones we will return to over and again. They ask not just about strategies for internationalization, but also the ways in which the vision and mission for universities, and the overall governance of
      the sector—nationally, regionally and globally—
      <em>may</em> be undermining or significantly altering the very purpose of the university. As <a href="http://president.ubc.ca/about-the-president/" target="_blank">Stephen Toope</a>, the University of British Columbia's outgoing president, <a href="http://u15.ca/what-we-are-thinking/universities-era-non-lieux"
      target="_blank">put it</a> in January 2014:</p>
    <p>A constellation of trends is pushing universities in the same direction—toward a homogenization that undermines our ability to fulfill the mission that has shaped our evolution over centuries. If universities cease to be highly differentiated, specific
      places with distinctive personalities, we will undermine the intellectual diversity needed to produce the catalysis that ignites new ideas, new discoveries and healthy social, cultural and economic innovation. </p>
    <p>'<a href="http://u15.ca/what-we-are-thinking/universities-era-non-lieux" target="_blank">Universities in an Era of 'Non-Lieux'</a>' by Toope is well worth reading for it provides some good food for thought on the pressures many universities are facing
      in this globalizing era.</p>

    <p>In closing, we encourage you to engage with our argument and material, to disagree with it, and to reformulate it. This is clearly our biased and situated (in Bristol and Madison) perspective.&nbsp; And while we both have plenty of air miles stored
      up, we're nevertheless just two people—a geographer and sociologist of education—who are blind to all sorts of forces and data. We love debate, we love to learn, and we really enjoy trying to create conducive learning and sharing spaces. </p>
    <p>So what is our challenge together? It is to take hold of, and transform, this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) into a Massive Open Online Resource (MOOR) so we can get to grips with what is happening in the evolving global higher education and research
      landscape and potentially reshape it. Enjoy the ride. </p>

    <h2>Week 1 Activity: </h2>
    <p class="lead">Globalizing Universities</p>
    <p>The purpose of the activities each week are to enable further thought and reflection upon the issues we've discussed in the text and podcasts, the building of connections between participants (including people with similar interests), the creation
      of a resource base for everyone to share, and an opportunity for you to begin acquiring a Statement of Accomplishment. As noted in the syllabus, you need to participate to be awarded a Statement.</p>

      <p>We have crafted two options to both provide structure but also flexibility for this week's activity. </p>
      <div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <div class="span6">
          <h4>
            <strong>Option A: What is 'global competency'</strong>?</h4>
          <p>Take a close listen to the podcast above with Madeleine Green, and the shorter podcasts that ask a selection of people to define 'global competency.' Once you have done this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                <em>Develop and post your ideal definition of</em>
              </strong>
              <em>
                <strong>global competency</strong>
              </em>, one that you think others should take note of, and even use, to encourage discussion and debate, or perhaps frame learning outcome objectives in a program.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>
                <em>Categorize the crucial elements of the concept of 'global competency'</em>
              </strong>. Think about all of the definitions you heard here, but also via reading, work-related activities, courses you've taken, and so on.
              <ul>
                <li>Is there a way you could
                  <strong>categorize </strong>the crucial elements of global competency? </li>
                <li>Or could you develop
                  <strong>compare and contrast</strong> options, highlighting important variation with respect how different types of people and different societies conceptualize of global competency or related concepts (e.g., inter-cultural competency, global
                  citizenship, global learning)?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note that you don't even need to agree with the idea of global competency to participate in this exercise – the concept exists and is having an impact in many higher education systems so let's get to work on unpacking it and interrogating
            it to see what it means, and to whom, and why. And if you fundamentally disagree with the notion of defining/legitimizing the concept, let us know via a measured critique, or even a creative rant.

          <h4>
            <strong>Option B: Visualizing models</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>As was evident in the figures above, there are a variety of ways that the internationalization strategies/models of universities can be visualized. We profiled some informative visualizations created by Gabriel Hawawini and colleagues, though
            we are aware these are but one way of representing models. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                <em>Create a visualization</em> that reflects, for example, the university in your city or region, the university you know best</strong>, the university you work in, or the university you want to build from scratch if you could?
              <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Or perhaps create a visualization that compares and contrasts how universities (e.g., from different parts of the world; public vs private; well-resourced vs resource constrained; American vs Canadian; the two key universities in your city;
              etc., etc.) are globalizing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Visualizations can be drawn on the back of a restaurant napkin, a piece of paper, a chalkboard, or a dry erase board. Photographs of these visualizations can be uploaded to the discussion forum. You can also create visualizations with a software
            package like Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator, Inkscape, or Google Docs Presentation or Drawing Apps and export these as image files to be uploaded. (See the
            <em><a href="../syllabus.html" target="_blank">syllabus</a></em> for more details.)</p>
          <p>There are no requirements with respect to how to do this–we just want you to visualize and help represent what is actually a very complicated phenomenon to make sense of. But we think it's worth the effort as visualizations can be highly effective
            communication vehicles.
