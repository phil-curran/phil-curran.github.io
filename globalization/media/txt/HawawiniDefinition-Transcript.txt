>> Hi Gabriel.  Could you tell us what is global competency?  

[00:00:07]
>> Well, global competency to me has to be defined at 3 levels, sort of a hierarchy if you want.  First it's about awareness and knowledge of people, cultures and places, practices around the world.  That's the first level.  Awareness.  Then the capacity to deal and work with people from different countries, located in different countries.  And finally I would say at the higher-level ability to lead multicultural teams, and help resolve multinational conflicts.  So it's about knowing first, and then doing, and finally leading in a global context.
