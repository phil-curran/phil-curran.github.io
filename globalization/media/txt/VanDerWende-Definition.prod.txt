>> Hello, Meric.  Could you tell us what you think global competency is?  

[00:00:07]
>> I think it is the set of knowledge skills that enable an individual to be successful, both as a person and professionally in the global world that we live in.  Here we emphasize that as global knowledge and international and intercultural competence.  And it has a lot to do with understanding, independence and economic force, but also skills like second and even third language competencies, ability to respond to cultural differences, other perspectives than ones own.
