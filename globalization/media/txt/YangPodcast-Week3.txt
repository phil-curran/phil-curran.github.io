[00:00:01]
>> Rui, great to speak to you, as a really keen observer of Chinese higher education policy and a specialist in that area.  I'm wondering if we could start off with the first question here, which is what you see as the, perhaps, we could say three key features of higher education policy currently in China.  What would you say these three key elements might be?  

[00:00:29]
>> Well, really it depends on which perspective you look at the Chinese system.  

[00:00:36]
>> Okay.  

[00:00:36]
>> And [clears throat] but if -- I think the first thing that came to my mind was Chinese higher education policy is overwhelmingly government-led.  

[00:00:47]
>> Yes.  

[00:00:47]
>> It's very much a top-down.  And that has also financial implications, money is not distributed equally to all kinds of institutions.  Money is actually distributed to selected universities and selected regions.  

[00:01:07]
>> So these are the --  

[00:01:08]
>> Yes sorry --  

[00:01:08]
>> -- the 211 universities and the -- what is it the 985--  

[00:01:13]
>> Yeah the -- because they are aiming at one-cost centers.  Therefore, what they call full-co investment.  A handful of universities.  That's fairly clear.  And compared -- I was reading actually, "East Asia Higher Education" this morning.  And compared to those institutions and systems in East Asia, for example -- China's neighbors -- China is even more ambitious, I think.  And China compared to Japan, for example, China has -- China's ambition is much more -- how to say -- elaborated.  Much clearly elaborated.  The target is fairly clear.  Very ambitious.  Yeah I would say.  

[00:01:52]
>> Ambitious around world-class.  And the thing that I've been noting about Chinese higher education policy, ambitious around positioning themselves in the rest of the world.  

[00:02:03]
>> Yeah.  

[00:02:04]
>> In terms of even a destination for students.  

[00:02:08]
>> Well with -- pardon me [coughs] I’ll drink a little bit, sorry.  Yeah.  We’ll come back to the students a little bit later.  But in terms of overall national policy, I think that in Chinese government eyes, they are very ambitious.  They want something very, very quick.  They have achieved quite remarkably in various aspects.  But I think that's also problematic.  Because they want something very, very quick.  And they invest, and they think they should get something back.  And you know, investment in higher education not always you get something so quick back.  So the direct link I think, as they perceive.  The direct link between higher education -- major higher education institutions and economic and social returns.  I think it's problematic.  But from their perspective, all compared to other systems, this is fairly obvious in China.  

[00:03:04]
>> Yeah.  But how is that different now?  This focus on, you know, big investment and world-class status and so on.  What did Chinese higher education policy look like perhaps, you know, 10 to 15 years ago?  Was it perhaps more equity-oriented would you say?  Or not?  

[00:03:23]
>> I think -- yeah it's all -- there are overlaps.  If you look at their work priorities, I think recently the Minister of Education issued their [coughs] pardon me -- 2014, priorities for their work.  Equity is certainly an issue there.  Equity in fact has been an issue in Chinese society.  But how can you link equity issue to what we said earlier [coughs] for good investment, and again top-down? Sometimes they do this separately.  And so a lot of issue -- a lot of major facts, I think they have, have been taken particularly at the provincial level and regional university level to meet the demands -- to try to meet the demands from more disadvantaged group, family background, students.  But in terms of [coughs] a handful of flagship universities,  
[00:04:24]
I think the emphasis, almost the same, you know, world-class.  

[00:04:29]
>> And does this mean investments in science and technology areas?  The STEM areas?  Or I mean what's the world class universities, I mean what's the profile of these world-class universities that's been fostered do you think?  

[00:04:44]
>> What's the -- well good question.  And I think the focus has been very much on a few things.  One is members.  Members and publication are overwhelming in science and technology, engineering, these kinds of areas. Much, much less in social science.  But I have to say -- I have to say, overall investment increased dramatically and therefore universities -- even social science and the humanities now have actually a lot of money.  Particularly in major universities.  You talk to them, they always tell me money is not the issue -- in social science.  But of course, compared to the natural science and technological sciences, investment focuses on those areas.  That's true.  

[00:05:38]
>> The --  

[00:05:38]
>> And they also -- yeah.  

[00:05:40]
>> No you go on.  You go on.  

[00:05:42]
>> No, I mean they focus more on something visible: publications.  Also they -- when they talk about world-class universities, they also mention two -- name two kinds of students.  One is a post-graduate student.  Particularly the proportion of post-graduate students to the undergraduate students.  They particularly emphasize international students -- the proportion of international student.  They do emphasize this indicator.  

[00:06:08]
>> So that --  

[00:06:09]
>> Yeah.  

[00:06:09]
>> That's been framed up by what would count as a world-class university, isn't it?  The Shanghai Jiao Tong model here.  

[00:06:16]
>> Yeah.  Yeah.  

[00:06:17]
>> Yeah.  

[00:06:17]
>> They also emphasize multidiscipline narrative.  How to say?  Inter-discipline narrative.  

[00:06:24]
>> Mm-hm.  

[00:06:24]
>> Notice I emphasize therefore, you see the institutional amalgamation.  And university wants you to have all different disciplines.  That's what they also emphasize a lot.  Yeah.  

[00:06:37]
>> Okay.  I mean if I -- there's -- looking at a UNESCO Report that has come out on the Asian region, which the participants in the MOOC will be looking at those -- some of those statistics.  What's interesting is that America, for example, is one of the second-largest sending countries now to China.  Along with the African region.  Again, may -- flows, smaller from Africa, but flows in the direction of China.  I mean where do those students go?  Do they go to institutions right across China?  Or are they selectively now going into these institutions that are aiming to be world-class?  

[00:07:24]
>> Oh interesting question.  Usually they go to better developed -- more developed areas.  But actually, when I did my fieldwork, I find [coughs] even in the area neighboring Russia, for example, you have American students.  You have Korean students.  You have Japanese students.  

[00:07:41]
>> Mm-hm.  

[00:07:42]
>> It really depends on their interest.  But overwhelmingly they go to more developed major cities and more developed areas.  And more established universities.  But in terms of American students, very few American students are going to China and enroll in degree programs --  

[00:08:01]
>> Okay.  

[00:08:02]
>> It is increasing, but still not so many.  Not only American, the European.  Australia, New Zealand; these developed countries.  And but many, particularly proportionately, many students from developing countries, they are studying for degrees in China.  

[00:08:21]
>> Yes.  Okay.  

[00:08:21]
>> Yeah.  

[00:08:22]
>> So would the American contingent -- because this is an interesting thing we're looking at when we're looking at student flows.  

[00:08:28]
>> Yeah.  

[00:08:28]
>> Often American students might include quite a large number of study abroad students.  You know, so you go there for a period of time --  

[00:08:36]
>> Yeah.  

[00:08:37]
>> -- a bit of an experience, but you're -- yeah.  So that's an interesting development.  

[00:08:41]
>> Yeah.  

[00:08:42]
>> But do you see this growing number of international students as generating local challenges?  I mean in Europe what we saw when students moved across Europe, that there was a strong tendency to try and teach in English right across Europe.  What would be the challenges across China as it increases the number of international students?  I mean is there a tendency to try and choose a language of instruction?  Or are students encouraged to learn Mandarin and that's what's happening?  

[00:09:18]
>> Both are I think happening.  

[00:09:19]
>> Mm-hm.  

[00:09:19]
>> And in absolute terms, both are increasing.  For those enrolled in degree programs, or as I say African students or other developing country students.  And they have one or two years -- increasingly have less -- you know, the less is less.  And they have one year roughly Mandarin classes, and then they enroll in the normal classes.  But for students from developed societies, the number is also increasing.  Sorry I forgot your question.  And --  

[00:09:54]
>> Well I just wondered what challenges it presents, you know, the local institutions.  

[00:09:58]
>> Oh yeah.  The challenges.  

[00:09:59]
>> Yeah.  

[00:09:59]
>> The challenges are severely a challenge.  Because -- for example, you came one, these Chinese lecturers do not have proper English to teach.  

[00:10:09]
>> Mm-hm.  

[00:10:09]
>> Even they think they have proper English.  It's actually far from satisfactory.  I interviewed a few people.  Those programs are well known in China, widely perceived as successful programs.  I was amazed to see, you know, these people -- in my eyes they are not qualified to teach in English.  But they were, you know, seen as successful programs.  Anyway, but these kind of international -- in English -- international programs.  These kinds of programs are building -- many universities are having these kinds of programs.  And they are still building up these kinds of programs.  Not only in Beijing and Shanghai, but also in other different places.  

[00:10:49]
>> China.  

[00:10:49]
>> Yeah.  China is also giving more scholarships.  That's for sure.  And that's more strategic.  But if you look at who they are giving -- you know, to whom they are giving scholarships, at the end it is the focus.  You know, and Africa for a long time they have a certain number.  They are again increasing.  But all the time, when I interview people, they -- particularly those in charge of this, and they say if you are white.  If you are in the States or you're in America.  Once you -- if you apply, usually you get it.  

[00:11:19]
>> Oh that's interesting.  

[00:11:19]
>> So yeah.  Yeah.  So they still put high priority to those European and American students.  But they are increasing scholarships.  And particularly to Asian and African countries and other developing countries, they are increasing.  

[00:11:36]
>> One of the activities we're asking the students to do on this class, on kind of nation-building and national strategies, is to actually look at China's internationalization strategy and to compare it with the English and Canadian.  So that will be quite interesting for the participants on this course.  Can I turn to this question around something you've written a lot about, which is a kind of political cultural kind of dimension really of the internationalization strategy.  And you have talked about it as in one way trying to deal with what China regards as a century of humiliation.  That to be a major player in the world -- particularly in the world of higher education -- has some anchors or roots in its history.  Can you comment on that?  

[00:12:31]
>> Yeah.  Well this is not easy to come - I need more time on this.  I like this topic.  That's very problematic on one hand.  But overall, let me say, international students seen in Chinese governments eyes is more soft power.  

[00:12:49]
>> Yes.  Yeah.  

[00:12:50]
>> Rather than compared -- in comparison with say, Australia or Canada.  You know, Australia particularly.  International students are a market, you know, money.  In Chinese people's eyes -- particularly the government people's eyes, their focus has always been -- even though they don't always say this clearly -- on the soft power part.  And -- but the soft power is related to this in historical, we could say, historical sentiment, over a century of humiliation.  The Chinese college of course, from ancient times, they are, you know, China means a flower, zhonghua means a flower in the center of the world.  So they call other people barbaric.  That for a long time was the mentality.  That mentality has never gone away.  That mentality changed dramatically because of the humiliation suffered by China in recent history.  So now once they -- only a little bit, not really, only a little bit development, they are very keen to show how great our Chinese culture is.  You cannot say this is absolutely wrong.  
[00:13:51]
You know?  However, I think they -- sometimes they are not patient enough and if you look at -- if you -- well this is government policy.  And if you look at academics, I'm trying to write something about a generational gap between academics.  If you look at academics who are now very active in China and who were born in 1970s and some late 60s, they now tend to be much, much more nationalistic.  That's not a good sign.  And that has direct impact on internationalization.  So internationalization for China is always a very difficult issue, because they can never get rid of that historical sentiment.  Therefore, very rarely for them can they sit down quietly and calmly, putting on the equal footing and try to address this issue.  Always very emotional.  

[00:14:47]
>> And just so that our listeners know what we're talking about when we're talking about soft power, we're talking about Nye's idea of soft power.  That you get some kind of power from being attractive and acquiring a status.  

[00:15:05]
>> Yeah.  

[00:15:06]
>> Does that mean also that where China's classically had a very large number of students particularly go to the United States, to engage in graduate studies, is China itself wanting to hold some of those -- that brainpower back in China for China's economic project back there?  

[00:15:29]
>> Certainly.  China has been trying very hard to attract these people back.  And they change their policy over time.  Previously they wanted people to come back.  And now they say, well, in Chinese terms are different.  You don't need to come back permanently, you can even come back for a short while or even visit.  So they want collaboration all the time, they have different kind of initiatives and programs to encourage these kind of people to come back.  Chinese people -- a large number of Chinese students are still going to Western countries to study.  The good sign is now it's more balanced.  The number coming to China to study in China.  The number is actually now bigger than Chinese people going abroad.  

[00:16:17]
>> Well that's really good.  

[00:16:19]
>> But still -- yeah, still, but in 2004 the number changed -- oh sorry, a study from 2008 the number changed.  But still a large number are going to Western countries, and still the best remain overseas.  They don't want to come back.  

[00:16:35]
>> Okay.  

[00:16:36]
>> And so China needs to [coughs] -- has all kinds of initiatives and programs to try to make good use of these people.  Policy is there, but a lot of issues are there.  Corruption is an issue and all kinds of issues.  Implementation has been fairly, fairly problematic.  But compared to say India for example, or Korea for example, China -- how China is trying to make good use of Chinese diaspora-  

[00:17:05]
>> Yes.  

[00:17:05]
>> Knowledge diaspora --  

[00:17:06]
>> Yes.  

[00:17:06]
>> I think it's more -- it's more -- I think more successful relatively.  

[00:17:13]
>> And of course you've written on that with Tony Welch.  

[00:17:16]
>> Yeah.  

[00:17:16]
>> And so if some of our MOOC participants wanted to follow up some of your writing, they could do that.  Now could I focus on this question of, nevertheless, despite huge numbers going through, there are, like in the United States and across Europe and so on, major problems in absorbing graduates.  Is -- how is the Chinese government managing that particular kind of headache? Lots of graduate students now who find it difficult to get the kind of employment they expected, given the investments that they've made financially in some cases.  

[00:17:55]
>> Yeah.  The situation is not getting better.  The situation is actually, to some extent, is getting even worse.  The -- it has become a political issue.  Because for many non-educated people, if they cannot find jobs it's politically safer.  But for these educated people, if they cannot get jobs, they walk around on the street, they will make some trouble.  So it's actually a political issue.  Therefore, the Chinese government, they even gave -- the central government -- even gave local government some political, you know, jobs; tasks.  You know, you have to try to make arrangements for these type of students.  But on the other hand, it's not because China does not need university graduates.  

[00:18:42]
>> Mm-hm.  

[00:18:42]
>> Simply because these university graduates only choose -- only want to stay in a few cities.  

[00:18:49]
>> Okay.  

[00:18:49]
>> Even if they come from all part of China, they only want to stay in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  

[00:18:57]
>> Well that's very interesting.  So it's very uneven in terms of development.  Perhaps the final question here, you're currently located in Hong Kong, which is now part of kind of the greater China region.  And I'm wondering, you know, given that you are in Hong Kong, but it's also now part of China, how does Hong Kong also -- - what are the dynamics going on in Hong Kong as perhaps a destination for other students around the world interested in China, but perhaps Hong Kong's a safer place? -- because when I go there to teach, for instance, what I notice is that Hong Kong is quite a different place now with international students there, than it was in the past. Could you comment on how you see what's going on in Hong Kong?  And whether my more anecdotal experiences are right?  I looked at some figures recently on the numbers of international students --  

[00:20:02]
>> Yeah.  Yeah.  

[00:20:02]
>> -- who were in the University of Hong Kong.  

[00:20:04]
>> Yeah.  

[00:20:04]
>> And it increased quite rapidly for example.  

[00:20:08]
>> Yeah.  Yeah.  We have different programs [coughs] in -- within institutions and at a government level.  For example, government -- each year, we have, I think you know this, a specific scholarship.  We try to attract -- the government tried to attract PhD students from all parts of the world.  I think last year it was something like more than 5,000 people apply.  Only 100 -- yeah, nearly 5,000 people apply; only 165 were granted.  

[00:20:43]
>> Oh my word.  

[00:20:43]
>> So it's highly competitive, and it was a very handsome scholarship, which is much higher than our own -- our normal studentship.  Even our normal studentship, by international standards, is very high.  But that scholarship is much better.  So the Hong Kong government deliberately, very aware of this issue, try to attract talents.  The issue is whether or not these people finish their PhD they will stay in Hong Kong.  Another issue is, we have -- you know, we call non-locals in the students.  We do.  When you look at our involvement -- myself for example -- we gave preference to other non-Chinese people.  But overwhelmingly still, our applicants are from mainland China and they are usually very good students.  So 80% of our graduate students are from the mainland China.  And most of them want to stay after study.  

[00:21:37]
>> Okay.  And can I just ask you, because it's not so clear in the way the figures are connected, and again this might be something you could help clarify.  And would a student from mainland China count as an international student on the ways in which the Hong Kong University's grants commissioned?  When they count those numbers are they counting mainland Chinese students as international students?  Or as -- how would they count them?  

[00:22:09]
>> Yeah they -- by answer, when they calculate them, they see them as international.  

[00:22:12]
>> Okay.  

[00:22:13]
>> But they don't call them politically incorrect, they don’t call them international.  Therefore they call non-local students.  Non-local.  

[00:22:20]
>> Okay.  

[00:22:21]
>> Yeah.  

[00:22:21]
>> So that's interesting.  So that's also a caution about how to read statistics and figures and so on.  

[00:22:28]
>> Yeah.  

[00:22:28]
>> Yeah.  So I think we have ranged over the questions I have sent, Rui, and I'm just really pleased we could talk to you because China's such an important player -- an increasingly important player in the dynamics between national strategies --  

[00:22:48]
>> Yeah.  

[00:22:49]
>> -- and these global dynamics.  

[00:22:52]
>> Yeah.  

[00:22:53]
>> And your thoughts and insights are really appreciated.  So thank you very much and --  

[00:22:58]
>> Okay.  

[00:22:59]
>> -- we look forward to sharing this with the students.  

[00:23:02]
>> Okay thank you.  Thank you Susan.
