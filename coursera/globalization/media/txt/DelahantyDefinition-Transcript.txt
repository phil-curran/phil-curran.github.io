>> Hi, James.  What does global competency mean to you?  

[00:00:06]
>> Global competency is an unfortunate phrase, I think, because nobody can be globally competent.  Who could seriously claim to possess competency in the way the world works and how its different parts work differently?  I'm sorry, but that's just too much knowledge.  If you think you have global competency, you're mistaken.  Since global competency is impossible, we're lucky as we go out in the world that there's something more important than knowledge, that's humility.  Humility is being aware that we aren't globally competent, that there are limits to what we can know, that we'll often be the least knowledgeable person in the room.  I hope you appreciate this irony.  I'm saying that functioning well in the world does not require global competency; it requires knowing that we lack it.
