>> Hi, Nigel, welcome to our MOOC, and thank you very much for sharing some of your insights and ideas with the participants in the course.  

[00:00:13]
>> Thank you.  

[00:00:14]
>> I have a few questions to ask you about the city, city-region theme, in particular how universities and cities, city-regions, the relationship between the two is evolving.  So why don't we actually start off closer to home, and I noticed looking at your university's mission that one of Warwick University's missions is to, quote, "serve our local region academically, culturally, and economically."  And that's quite a common sort of broad objective that I've seen in a number of institutions.  Could you help outline the ways that University of Warwick is embedded in and contributes to your local city-region, broadly defined?  

[00:01:01]
>> Very happy to do that.  I think there are probably three main ways.  The first of these is the one that, if you were coming to the university, would probably be most obvious most immediately is cultural.  We have a very large art center, and we have very large amounts of audience that come from all around the city and the region in order to go to the various events and performances at that art center.  And if you like you can see us then as a cultural lighthouse in the city-region.  Secondly, going on from that though, the thing that probably people would talk most about is the university's very strong contribution to the economy of the city and the region.  We are undoubtedly one of the key economic players in the city-region simply by virtue of the number of people who are employed by the institution.  
[00:02:06]
But more importantly, in some ways, through the other things that we do we have an enormous economic footprint.  The most obvious of these is through an entity called the Warwick Manufacturing Group, and that's involved basically in the automotive industry, and we are in a way one of the research and development centers now for the whole of the British sports and motor industry, but specifically for a company called Jaguar Land Rover, which has been massively successful recently.  And part of the reason for that has been the interaction that we have back and forth with them.  So that's the second thing.  And that is an economic interaction which actually is both very local in that it produces jobs in the city and region, and also at the same time global in that it pulls all sorts of investment back into the region from around the world.  
[00:03:12]
Then the last contribution is simply educational.  The university, like many universities, does lots and lots of outreach work, and that's symbolized by us, I think, by the fact that we just set up a school.  And that school will teach engineers from the age of 14 onwards. It adds a real contribution in a sense to what is going on in the educational system for the city and the region actually has, and in trying to make it better.  

[00:03:48]
>> That last point I guess begs the question: has this relationship between the university and the city region changed in any notable ways over the last decade or so?  

[00:03:58]
>> Yes, it has.  The first thing that's happened is that economically our interaction with the automotive industry keeps growing and growing and growing.  And so for example, we're now setting up a national automotive innovation campus, the only one in the country.  And that is an absolutely vast enterprise.  Going on from that, I'm not sure that ten years ago, for example, that we would have actually intervened in secondary school education.  Now we actually think that thatâ€™s a duty that we should fulfill.  

[00:04:38]
>> Okay.  Okay, that's great.  Thank you.  I note that Warwick University is also strategically active in two other city-regions some distance away, New York City and Melbourne.  Why did you choose to get involved in these two city-regions, and how do you think these overseas experiments or ventures will benefit the UK-based campus community?  

[00:05:06]
>> Sure.  So we got involved in those city-regions for different reasons.  In New York we got involved with a number of overseas partners.  We could talk a little bit more about that if necessary.  But it was very much a cooperative venture.  In Melbourne, it was part of a longer-term plan which is to produce a university which actually can operate at a large number of sites around the university -- sorry, around the world -- but at the same time is not going to cost an absolute vast amount to produce.  And the reasons of the benefits for that I think are very apparent already for both staff and students.  For staff, it's the ability to have careers that are in more than one place, and increasingly for university staff that's become imperative in terms of their ability to function.  
[00:06:06]
There's a definite relationship between how good you are as an academic and the places that you're involved in.  And then going on from that, for students it's the ability to study for their degrees in lots of places as part of the degree.  If you like, we're trying to produce multinational degrees.  

[00:06:29]
>> Okay, that makes sense.  I mean, if we think about the New York case, perhaps you could unpack that experiment a little bit more, talk about the logic and rationale for cooperating with others to establish and work in association with this Center For Urban Society and Progress?  

[00:06:50]
>> So the answer I think is there, in a funny kind of way, it comes directly to city-regions in that what we were trying to produce in our university was a substantial degree of urban expertise, but based around some of the big new developments that are going on around big science.  At the same time, NYU and Toronto were effectively trying to do the same thing.  Then this competition came along in New York City, and we ended up cooperating with each other in order to produce the Center For Urban Society and Progress, which is very much, if you like, based on so-called big data, and what you can actually do with it in large, global cities.  

[00:07:44]
>> Okay.  I guess the last question is in some ways the broadest and there's obviously many different ways to sort of answer this, but what do you think about the evolving relationship between higher education institutions and systems, and cities and city-regions?  Are there some broadly discernible patterns or sort of trends that are emerging or is this a long standing relationship that really isn't changing that much?  

[00:08:16]
>> So, to a degree at least there isn't any change.  What's happened I think is simply that many universities have grown a lot larger over the last twenty or thirty years, and therefore they've become more imposing actors, if I can put it that way, within their city and regions, with more ability to do things for their cities and regions. And that's a trend that happened in many ways around the world.  But then going on from that, it's also the case, I think, that just as cities are increasingly linking up, there are networks that span the global cities, so there are going to be networks of universities.  Which often will, if you like, replicate those other city networks.  So it's both normal organic growth producing more and more in position, and at the same time it's also this kind of growth networks.  

[00:09:24]
>> Okay.  Great.  Well, thank you very much, we appreciate your insights and good-bye.
