>> Hello Gabriel, thank you very much for speaking to everybody in our MOOC.  We really appreciate your presence in the course.  I've got a questions to ask you and why don't we start off really with first which is more of a definition one.  How would you define the internationalization of higher education institutions with an emphasis on really the concept of internationalization?  So what is internationalization?  

[00:00:33]
>> Well Kris, I believe there are two aspects to that process we call internationalization.  And hence I would say two definitions.  The first I would argue is an inward-looking definition.  Internationalization is about injecting an international dimension in all aspects and activities of the institution.  Its curriculum.  Its students, faculty, bring in that international dimension across the board.  I call it that inward-looking definition or an import model.  The other definition I would say is an outward-looking, export model.  And in that case we're talking about internationalizing by taking the institution abroad.  
[00:01:33]
Making the move outside of your home campus.  And of course as we realize the two are not mutually exclusive.  Typically you would start with an import inward-looking approach and you might then follow this up with an export outward-looking approach. Thank you.  

[00:01:54]
>> Okay.  I guess that would lead me really to the next question which is what do you think some of the key academic and also nonacademic motives are for internationalizing higher education institutions?  So what is the motive, the motives that you see driving these processes?  

[00:02:15]
>> Surely.  I would argue actually that in an academic context, the academic motive, if you want, is quite similar to what you would argue if you're not internationalizing.  By which I mean if it is about fulfilling your institution's mission which is typically for a higher education institution, it's about education.  It's about research.  So if you think about the educational mission of an institution then you would like to educate as many people as possible and not just locally but also including foreign potential students.  That is the academic motive from an educational perspective.  And to conduct research, I would argue that today research is increasingly an international activity because to put it simply, knowledge and expertise is dispersed, available around the world.  
[00:03:28]
So to summarize the academic motive is about fulfilling the institution's mission and that mission can be extended to an international dimension.  On the nonacademic motives, then I would add in that case things such as the desire to grow, the desire to grow and no longer being able to do it at home.  The desire for higher revenue and finally, in that category I would add typically it is a response to competitive pressure.  I.e., peer institutions are actually going abroad or internationalizing, so this pressure to do the same for my institution.  
[00:04:29]
That would be a summary of the academic and nonacademic motives.  

[00:04:36]
>> Okay.  That's great.  I imagine, you know, both with respect to the institutions you've been involved in, the other ones that you as well have collaborated with or that you know about that the motives have changed and evolved over time.  Given your experience and your position, what kinds of patterns have you seen with respect to the evolution of motives for internationalization?  How have they evolved really over time?  

[00:05:04]
>> I would say that the nonacademic motives are becoming somewhat more prominent these days.  Often the move abroad or an internationalization program technically the move abroad is more considered decision to make as a competitive move.  Others are doing it.  We should be doing it too.  And I would argue that probably the essence of the academic motive, the fulfillment of your mission is no longer as prominent as it used to be.  

[00:05:50]
>> Okay.  Now I mean and on a related note really, if you think about this in a less perhaps general universal sense, are there any particular types of sort of institutional, sectoral for example, public versus private disciplinary or geographic patterns to the evolution of these motives?  Do you see particular -- for example, business school --  

[00:06:18]
>> Sure.  

[00:06:18]
>> -- related agendas being quite significantly different than perhaps broad public comprehensive institutions?  

[00:06:26]
>> Right.  Yes, to some extent one can actually observe the phenomenon that you were referring to in your question.  I would say that in general private institutions have been more active in this field.  And again their reason is related again to the mission.  A public university typically has a local mission.  It's supported by local government to educate local people.  So a move abroad or an outward-looking internationalization process is unlikely to happen.  What we might see there is probably internationalizing by an inward-looking approach.  So yes I would say private universities have been more active there than the public ones for the obvious reason I have just mentioned.  
[00:07:35]
In terms of geography, I would say that institution that tend to be in smaller countries have been more inclined to internationalize because they're smaller again.  They tend to be more open, more connected to the world.  Limited in their local mission to educate people so there is a size effect, no doubt about it.  So yes I would argue private versus public, large or small companies, would be elements that factor into that distinction you are making.  

[00:08:14]
>> Okay, great.  Thank you very much.  In examining the paper that you wrote, a very informative paper, “The Internationalization of Higher Education Institutions,” I was struck by your emphasis on the value and impact but also some of the challenges associated with stretching out institutional fabrics across space and in particular, establishing branch campuses.  Can you flesh out some of the positive impacts that you see associated with stretching out at higher education institution's institutional fabric across global space and embedding it in a, you know, fairly deep and substantial way in new societal, new political, new cultural, and geographic context?  

[00:09:03]
>> Yes.  Yes I would -- related to your question, Kris, I would argue that if an institution of higher education wants to become truly global and that's the starting point is what are you aiming for.  But if your objective is to become solely global, then I would argue that that institution has to move out of its comfort zone and, so to speak, free itself from localized routines.  I would argue it must experience the world.  Confront the challenges of setting up abroad hoping that it would eventually, of course, change behaviors on the home campus.  So there is this outward move.  The necessity of it if you want to really transform things but then in the hope that they will feed back into the original location and also change it.  
[00:10:17]
That would be the way I see it in terms of those transformational moves.  

[00:10:28]
>> Okay.  You mentioned with respect to the response there, the very important issue about sort of mission, vision, objectives.  On the basis of what you've experienced in your own institution which has very much globalized but also what you've learned about other institutions.  What is the ideal process to generate consensus, clarity of vision as much as possible at least and a clarification of missions and motives with respect to the internationalization process?  

[00:11:04]
>> I would refer to my own institution and what we went through.  And thinking about what would be the or what has been the process then and whether that process could be replicated.  I would say that what has worked for us is that we have been able to identify key members of the faculty, key administrators, I would say alumni are also important, trustees.  You have to identify among these people those that would act as champions, as ambassadors.  You will not be able to necessarily rally everyone from day one.  If you are able to identify key people that would act as champions then you can actually get the process going.  
[00:12:10]
You know, Kris, there are always going to be skeptics and defenders of the status quo.  And you have to start from the premise that you cannot win everyone and you should not even try to.  You can only hope that the champions will be given a chance to experiment and if successful, if successful they will hopefully win over those who were sitting or are sitting on the fence so to speak.  And then what we notice is that once the momentum is set things start moving reasonably quickly.  So to summarize: recognize that you will not win everyone into the process but identify the champions, work with them, and let them act as ambassadors to achieve your objective.  

[00:13:12]
>> Okay.  Great.  Thank you very much.  On the basis of your experience working through the consensus-building process but recognizing, again, that there wasn't complete buy in, you've now had a fair bit of experience in relatively deep and comprehensive internationalization.  So what do you think are some of the most positive and perhaps there's some challenges or negative impacts as well about deep and very comprehensive internationalization, and in particular really from a faculty or a research perspective, where they're required or strongly incentivized or encouraged to get out of their comfortable home base and become embedded in a very different and more challenging again, societal, political, economic context?  

[00:14:00]
>> Yes, Kris, you rightly pointed out that this is a crucial element in the entire process.  For obvious reasons, one cannot think of internationalizing particularly with the outward approach unless one has rallied the faculty and large segment of the faculty for that cause.  So let me backtrack for a second and I think your question is well posed?  What are the pluses and minuses?  And just to think about it conceptually a bit.  I would say for faculty conducting research there is a tension, I would say, between two models of idea generation.  There is, of course, I'm simplifying here.  At one extreme there is the core location model and the other there is the network model.  
[00:15:05]
So let me explain: the core location model is actually the model that those who subscribed to it, to the core location model believe that proximity to other researchers is the key to producing ideas.  So the point here is I want my colleagues near me.  I want them on the same corridor.  I want them on the office next door because talking to them and interacting with them permanently is what gives me ideas.  So that is the core location model and, obviously, if you subscribe to this one you would be reluctant to subscribe to the outer model that says let's go abroad and branch out.  Now the opposite view, the network model, in this case those who subscribe to it believe that knowledge and expertise are spread out around the world.  
[00:16:16]
And that a global network of researchers in various location to one another is the key to breakthrough idea generations.  The danger with the core location model is that we're all in the same place and we may end up all about thinking the same way.  May have the same ideas.  May tackle problems in the same fashion but if we are dispersed, if we are actually in various locations around the world, we may actually be able to come up with breakthrough ideas by mixing our multiple perspectives.  So this is it.  There is no way to say one is superior to the other.  One can actually go into this in more detail and say for certain discipline, for certain fields core location makes more sense than networking but anyway, these are the two positions.  
[00:17:21]
In the context, for example, of my own school which is a management school, which is a business school, we felt that the network model made sense because of the context of management.  It does change from one location to another and that there may be gains from the network model.  So this is the way I would answer your question, Kris.  

[00:17:44]
>> Okay.  Well, great.  Thank you very much.  We really appreciate all of your insights and I'll stop right now.  So thanks Gabriel.  

[00:17:56]
>> Okay.
