>> Hi Nigel, welcome to our MOOC and thank you very much for participating and sharing some of your insights and expertise with respect to rankings, benchmarking and bibliometrics.  

[00:00:17]
>> Thank you Kris for having me.  This is a subject of which I believe that we’re thinking in my part of world a lot, I suppose, and I'm glad for the opportunity to share some thoughts on the subject.  

[00:00:35]
>> Okay, well great.  Why don't we don't start off and perhaps situate the discussion in a little bit more of a historical context.  So why do you think we witness the increased use and influence of world university rankings, benchmarking and bibliometric analyses of research at this particular point in the history of higher education, both at a global scale but in a, also I realize differentially and different world regions, including the one that you're in right now?  

[00:01:10]
>> Yes, I believe that the importance of ranking, bibliometric analyses and benchmarking are to a large degree driven by what I call the corporatization of tertiary education, tertiary education becoming corporate.  Over the past two decades, say, many would know policy-makers, students, parents have come to view tertiary education as hugely beneficial, both for national growth and development and also for private advancement.  As a result, there's really been a massive increase in the number of universities, both public and private, profit and not-for-profit and this stretches across the globe.  Enrollment too has undergone massive increases. At my own university,  
[00:02:14]
we have grown from 22,000 to 50,000 in ten years, and this is probably true in many other parts of the world.  Today, I believe that the rules of the marketplace and globalization have pushed universities and colleges really to compete with each other and they must.  They have large numbers of students, large numbers of stakeholders, and universities must compete both locally and nationally.  Students have to compete for research, funding, from philanthropy and of course other forms of commerce.  And in the spirit of the marketplace you know these customers, and I'm calling customers in this way of students from the agencies, philanthropists and so on, how the customers assess the university is really to look to rankings as a measure of value.  
[00:03:27]
So it is true that, you know, in the past universities actually, people did have to choose between universities but they did so by qualitative measures, usually reputation.  Today it's a very crowded field from which customers have to choose.  And so they are turning increasingly to what seems to be a quantitative measure.  And the quantitative measure that is gaining credence, you know, perhaps globally is rankings, these rankings being a proxy for value.  And to summarize this point, the large increase in universities and the numbers of universities, the large increase in the numbers of students has created a competitive environment, and in that environment the measure of value may be complex, difficult to assess. So everyone turns to rankings, hence the importance of ranking today.  

[00:04:51]
>> I guess that begs the question, and perhaps you can weigh university leaders’ perspective, the University of West Indies perspective, what are the pros and the cons of taking into account rankings, for example, versus benchmarking, versus thinking about the bibliometric analyses of your researchers’ research output?  

[00:05:15]
>> Yes, well you know, first I'm sure that you know the University of the West Indies covers all of the Caribbean sea’s widely-placed — in the Anglophone Caribbean — many, many islands where we are placed.  And for many years we were the only university in the English-speaking Caribbean.  Today that picture has changed completely.  The number of national and international universities competing for students and competing for funding.  And in these circumstances, students are increasingly looking at what measures they can use to select our university or other universities.  
[00:06:15]
I think similarly, policy-makers are increasingly demanding of us that we turn out graduates who are more employable, that their research meets national and even global comparatives.  So in the past decade, you know, driven by strategic plans, we have paid much more attention than in the past to maximizing student experience, to production of graduates with more practical skills, ensuring our research productivity and indeed increasing our outreach to communities in the region.  Now how do we demonstrate that we in fact have been undergoing those changes, how do we demonstrate this to our stakeholders?  
[00:07:20]
And in this context, one modality that we use is university rankings.  Now this hasn't taken hold to a great degree in the region, but people have become more attentive to it and so rankings would be one of the systems, as well as the bibliometric analyses.  The system that we have — but we’ve also been paying attention to benchmarks and getting increasingly important benchmarking exercises, because what that does is it takes a particular operation within the university, for instance research management or student experiences and so on, and it enables us to identify among a group of like universities what is best practice.  
[00:08:27]
And then we can assess wherever we are with respect to the best practice and refashion what it is we do in a given operation to better meet the best practice.  So the benchmarking has gained particular favor in our circumstance.  The ranking we are paying increasing attention to simply because, in the circumstances in which we are living, we can't ignore it.  

[00:08:58]
>> Okay.  That's good, that helps sort of differentiate the three, sometimes they’re conflated as well, rankings and benchmarking in particular.  I know you've been wrestling with some issues around the relevancy of rankings, you noted, but also the tools of benchmarking and so on, with respect to your particular institution and your regional perspective.  But, what sort of values and priorities and societally specific if any assumptions underlie the most influential world university rankings? And here, why don't we focus in on world university rankings, for example the QS, the Shanghai, or the Times Higher rankings.  

[00:09:46]
>> Yes, as I mentioned earlier that world rankings of universities have become somewhat synonymous with their apparent value, and increasingly nations and even international agencies are looking at countries and really determining, if you will, assessing how many globally competitive universities exist within the country. And that measure, to a degree, is being used as a proxy for competitiveness and attractiveness for any investors, any investors wanting to come to that particular country.  And so policy-makers have become very attentive to, you know, how many — how well their universities are doing, and indeed what that has meant is that they are investing more and more in performance indicators, you know, or in their universities attaining apparent excellence in areas that are important in ranking schemes.  
[00:11:28]
And so I think that, you know, in terms of where policy-makers are going their investments then become, you know, very, very skewed.  Indeed, the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities, I gather, began because the Chinese government thought that their universities weren't doing well enough globally, and in that context basically they created a global ranking so that their universities might, if you will, enhance what it would do to match some of what were estimated to be some of the most competitive in the world. And their ranking scheme, of course, emphasizes science and technology, as most rankings schemes do.  

[00:12:36]
>> That I guess leads to the next question, and I'm trying to think — you've dealt with several aspects of the next question, but there might be a few additional points that you'd like to make again. In particular, wearing your leader’s hat at the University of the West Indies, but are there any other significant noteworthy impacts of rankings about debates, about policy or strategy or research foci that you'd like to note?  So here we're really trying to sort of flesh out not just the rhetoric about the impact of rankings but the reality of the impact of rankings.  

[00:13:24]
>> Yes, well, in my part of the world, ranking is relatively a peripheral consideration to policy-makers in terms of making decisions about funding our university or other national universities. One must state that in the developing world, you know, where resources are limited, we don't have the ability to do large cutting-edge science.  We can't attract Nobel Prize-winners and other prominent academics.  Very difficult in attracting large numbers of engineers and international students.  All of those being indicators of ranking systems.  And so, in that context, ranking as yet, given our limitations is really not the major metric, if you will, that our policy-makers are looking at in assessing our value.  
[00:14:42]
But, and in truth, let me say, in a larger context, I don't think it's an altogether bad thing. Because what I believe ranking does in many instances is it distorts the allocation of funding, or it could distort the allocation of funding to tertiary education.  For instance, in a number of countries where ranking is important, funds are largely allocated to research-intensive programs at the expense of other institutions that might provide a more nurturing environment for their students.  In addition, ranking systems tend to emphasize performance in science and technology and engineering and medicine, the STEM subjects, and I believe they undervalue the humanities and the arts.  
[00:15:48]
And in so doing, I think it takes away important aspects of quality of life and the aesthetics of living, which are so important within the context of any country.  You know, and, I believe that really, this emphasis on STEM — as important as it is because, obviously, in the world in which we live, technology is the major engine of at least economic advancement — I believe that you can't undervalue, you can't undermine the creative genius of the arts because they themselves are major contributors to national growth and ampification of societal value.  
[00:16:57]
So again, as I said, I may be a little happy that we are not as yet, in our society, putting tremendous emphasis on ranking because, at least, we are still able to balance our investment, not only in the sciences, but in the creative arts and the humanities as well.  

[00:17:22]
>> Okay, thank you.  We've been talking a lot about some issues around the metrics, the impact of rankings, changing use of them over time.  One question I have now, though, relates to the issue of where the debate is focused.  We see a lot of debate about impact.  We see a lot of debate about, probably the most, about methodology and weighting and these sorts of things, which disciplines are emphasized.  But, and correct me if I'm wrong, we don't seem to see that much focus on actually the nature of the new actors, these new authorities, these new often private-sector firms that are driving the development and spread of these tools.  Why do you think that might be the case?  

[00:18:22]
>> Well, you know, I think that to most universities, you know, their ranking is important.  Being able to participate in the game, if you call it a game, is much more important than who constructs the game.  Now, I think if universities as a whole were to refuse to provide these firms with data, and to cease participating, then the ranking firms would not be successful.  But invariably, the winners in the ranking exercise are — tend to be the most influential universities worldwide -- and I think that it's unlikely that they will destroy the very system that gives them competitive advantage.  And, remember, I keep emphasizing, we're in a world competing for students, finances, and other elements.  
[00:19:23]
There's a world of customers, so to speak.  And so, if you're doing well in that world, you know, why destroy the system?  As for the rest, you know, the others who may not, you know, get in the first 200 or the first 500, they often want to be in the game, and so they're concentrating on how can the methodology of ranking be changed, become more inclusive?  And, indeed, they can be recognized and acknowledged and be given, in their circumstances, a competitive advantage.  So, you know, I don’t — in no circumstances, the sentiment is, well, that the profits are so great that these companies developing these systems, and the fact that the parents of the system, you know, see this and use this for competitive advantage,  
[00:20:39]
You have, let's say, two permissive parties dancing with each other and, you know, for one, you know, for one to say, well, the other must go, they put them, you know, at a disadvantage that they don't want to deal with right now.  So the forms keep increasing, they keep doing well, and that’s because because the parents want to play.  

[00:21:10]
>> Yes.  That, I guess, leads to our, really, the final question, and you've touched upon some, I guess, themes in relationship to this.  I mean, are there any sort of bigger, broader conversations that have yet to be held about this phenomenon and how to deal with it?  You noted, for example, some of the universities that get ranked highly, it’s not in their interest to, perhaps, try to work to, in the end, pull down this system that actually legitimizes and supports them.  There might be, though, for example, other players that haven't got involved in the debate.  Or there have been calls, for example, for creating common datasets at a global scale or for, perhaps, even regulating rankers or getting international organizations more involved.  So, are there -- these are just a few examples but, are there any other big important conversations that have yet to be held about world university rankings and the firms that are promoting them, from your perspective?  

[00:22:22]
>> Yes, look, I feel that good universities should be asking themselves certain questions.  You know, one is, how do we maximize the knowledge, the skills, the attributes of our graduates, who are going to enter a complex world?  That is, who are going to require in their lifetime, that they will probably have to keep reinventing themselves every decade of their lives.  So, how do we prepare, how do we best prepare our graduates for such a world?  We also have to ask ourselves, you know, how do we motivate and incentivize our academic staff to pursue ideas and innovative products that will advance mankind, that will contribute to the well-being and growth of their own people, whether nationally, regionally, you know, or globally?  I think universities should also be reaching out to make a difference to the welfare and lives of people who exist in their neighborhoods, in their communities, in their nations in a larger context, and that  
[00:23:37]
the university community should really provide value in that particular way.  Now, I don't think any single university has the answers as how best to do any of this, and I believe that universities and rankings and the bibiliometric analyses, have very limited value.  They really, I don't think, provide the know-how, the knowledge, and the best practices the way, you know, that one wants.  What I've been thinking is that, perhaps, at regional, national, regional, or global levels, there can be established high standards, which high standards, which may vary according to a nation or region or world, about best practice.  
[00:24:41]
Best practice in teaching and learning, best practice in research, what one should aim for, how an academic staff might be composed, what are the sorts of measures that one wants out of such a body.  That one could conceivably establish what should one be aiming for, and even setting some stretch goals, you know, not actually only best practice, but what might be stretch goals for an institution.  I think, if one can, you know, sort of bring together communities of universities and policy-makers and other stakeholders to establish those standards, then individual universities will have something against which they can measure themselves, and then go about the policy, go about the process, of quality-improvement and change and other, you know, there's the gap.  
[00:25:55]
You know, what do we need to do differently to attain what we believe, you know, needs to be the ideal.  And what that does is, it would take the system away from these various private entities doing the rankings and such, and put it in the hands of universities and their stakeholders, and indeed ensure, if you were all to play in such a system, ensure that their continues to be improvements in quality in what universities are supposed to be doing.  That even would be, a system such as something like that would be far more enriching, far more beneficial for the universities, policy-makers, and students than trying to find some single measure that somehow connects all that a university does and says, "This is the value by which we are going to assess universities."  

[00:27:08]
>> Yes, well, that's a great point, I think, to end off on, and it raises all sorts of issues that need to be grappled with, and will raise all of sorts of, no doubt, debates in our MOOC this week.  So, on that note, I'd like to say thank you very much on behalf of all the participants, and we really appreciate your willingness to share some of your insights and knowledge with us.  

[00:27:35]
>> Thank you so very much Kris, for having me.  I hope this goes well.  

[00:27:39]
>> Okay, thank you.  Bye-bye.  

[00:27:41]
>> Bye-bye.
