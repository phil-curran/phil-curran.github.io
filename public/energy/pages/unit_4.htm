<p class="lead">Our focus: examining our future energy prospects, which generally are brighter than some expect.</p>
<h4>What will be covered</h4>
<p>At the conclusion of this unit, you will be able to summarize expected future energy supply and demand patterns. You will also be able to explain what is meant by fossil fuel “reserves,&quot; and discuss the origin of nuclear fuels and the implications of their use. You will also be able to describe some energy energy technologies.</p>
<p>After this unit, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize expected energy supply and demand patterns through 2100.</li>
<li>Explain what is meant by the term “reserves” and discuss its implications for the future of geologic fuels.</li>
<li>Discuss the origin of nuclear fission fuels and the implications of their use.</li>
<li>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of emerging energy technologies.</li>

<h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit's reading</h3>
<p>The idea that we are about to run out of fossil fuels has been with us nearly as long as fossil fuels themselves. A continual procession of prognosticators have foretold their imminent decline, based on the seemingly commonsense principle that reserves are finite but future demand is not. These predictions all share one feature in common: they have all failed. For better or worse, fossil fuel supplies have proven surprisingly resilient.</p>
<p>This excerpt from the book "Geofuels: Energy and the Energy" examines the reasons why have so consistently defied predictions for their demise.</p>

</ul><br>
<h4>Optional reading</h4>
<p>Fossil fuel combustion unavoidably releases CO2 as a byproduct, but it does not necessarily need to escape into the atmosphere.  It is possible instead to capture CO2 and permanently sequester it.  Various options for doing this have been proposed, but the leading candidate is deep underground injection.  Underground injection of CO2 has been routinely practiced for decades by the petroleum industry, as a way to enhance the recovery of oil from conventional reservoirs.  The technology to geologically store CO2 therefore already exists.</p>
<p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) works best when using point-sources of relatively CO2, avoiding the need to extract it directly from the atmosphere.  Typical point sources might include coal-fired power plants, ethanol refineries, and cement plants.  The required technology has been tested at a number of pilot projects.  However, there are also a number of potential obstacles to the large-scale use of CCS.</p>
<p>The following reading/slideset examines the basics of CCS, along with some of its challenges.</p>

Current production rates and estimated reserves are both the highest they have ever been however. This apparent paradox stems from the fact that reserves depend not just the natural occurrence of fossil fuels, but also on investment in their development and on available extraction technologies. The currently known reserves do not represent an ultimate physical limit.</td>

Effective solutions have been developed for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel, although their implementation varies by country.
