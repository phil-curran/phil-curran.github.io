<h3>Your Personal Energy Use</h3>
<p>We use energy in virtually every aspect of our lives, although we might not always realize we are doing so. On a global basis, approximately 87% of our primary energy supply is provided by fossil fuels, which means that our personal energy use has direct implications for greenhouse gas emissions. Our individual impact varies greatly between different regions however, and even between different individuals living within the same region.</p>
<p>This activity is designed to help you explore your personal “energy identity”, based on your perceptions of your own energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>In the first part of the activity</strong>, you will respond to a 10-question survey that should take less than 30 minutes to complete. Your answers will be used to construct an analysis of energy use patterns among the group taking this course. The results of the analysis will be presented later in this course and will help you compare your personal energy use to that of others. (All data presented in the analysis will be anonymous.)
</p><p><strong>The second part of the activity</strong> involves responding to <strong>one</strong> of the two discussion questions listed below using the course discussion board.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Part 1: Survey</h4>
<p><a href="https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_5cpcpjq7YNr6LvT" target="_blank">Complete the personal energy use survey here.</a> (This will open in a new browser tab or window.)</p>
<hr>
<h4>Part 2: Question responses</h4>
<p>Choose <strong>one</strong> of the following two questions to post your response to in the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=UWS1-9387632"><strong>Unit One Discussion Forum</strong></a>. (You can click either of the questions to go directly to it in the discussion board.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=UWS1-9387633">1. How do you think your CO2 emissions compare to your other in your region, in other parts of the world? Why do you think your emissions differ from others?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=UWS1-9387634">2. If you had to reduce your personal CO2 emissions, how would you do it? What tradeoffs would you be willing to make?</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<h4>Additional advanced options</h4>
<p>If you would like to perform a more detailed analysis of carbon emissions resulting from your personal energy use, take a look at the following online carbon footprint calculators:</p>
<p><a href="http://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/carboncalculator" target="_blank">CoolClimate Carbon Footprint Calculator, University of California, Berkeley</a><br>
Calculates your personal carbon footprint, for locations in the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="http://footprint.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">International Student Carbon Footprint Challenge, Stanford University</a><br>
  Calculates your personal carbon footprint, for locations worldwide.</p>
