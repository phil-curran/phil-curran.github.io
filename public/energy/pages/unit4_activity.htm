<h3>Electrical Utility Planning Using JuiceBox<sup>TM</sup></h3>
<p>One of the three main themes of the course has been that energy tradeoffs are inevitable, and that there is no free lunch. This theme has emerged repeatedly in the videos, in the reading, and during discussions.</p>
<p>This week’s activity provides you with a unique opportunity to explore these tradeoffs in more of a more quantitative fashion, by playing the role of an electrical utility planner. Electrical utilities strive to meet three basic goals. The power they generate should be <strong><em>reliable</em></strong>, meaning that it continuously meets consumer demand, it should be <strong><em>clean</em></strong>, meaning that it minimizes the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, and it should be <strong><em>affordable</em></strong>, meaning that it does not inflict undue economic hardship.</p>
<p>These goals embody certain inevitable tradeoffs.  For example, power obtained from coal-fired power plants is reliable and cheap, but its use results in substantial greenhouse gas emissions.   Power obtained from solar and wind causes no appreciable emissions, but its availability varies with the time of day and the weather.  Nuclear power plants combine the reliability of coal with the low emissions of solar and wind, but are subject to concerns about their safety and the environmental impact of waste storage.</p>
<p>The activity makes use of an electrical grid simulator called <strong><a href="http://juicebox.org" target="_blank">Juicebox</a></strong>, which was developed by <strong><a href="https://energy.wisc.edu/about/people/meier" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Meier</a></strong>. Although this particular Juicebox simulation only addresses one particular geographic area (the state of Wisconsin), its underlying principles are applicable anywhere.</p>
<p>Your objective is to design an electrical generation plan for a ten-year period, based on your own prioritization of the tradeoffs inherent to this problem. <i>The version of Juicebox that you will use has been simplified for use in this class.</i></p>
<p>Based on the default starting point of the simulator, Wisconsin will have adequate generating capacity under normal conditions through 2025. However, its peak capacity gradually falls behind required peak capacity, and its CO2 emissions exceed the target level.</p>

<h4>Before You Start</h4>
<p>I recommend that you familiarize yourself with Juicebox before getting started. Dr. Meier has provided a video tutorial to using Juicebox, <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9F59xHhBrI" target="_blank">available here</a></strong>. Then, review the Juicebox Quick Guide <strong>
<a href="../files/Juicebox Quick Guide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Dr. Meier will join the class during Week 4 to answer your questions about using Juicebox. Please direct all of your questions regarding the use of Juicebox to the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/earthenergy-001/forum/list?forum_id=10018">Week 4 sub-forum titled <strong>"Juicebox Q&amp;A / Help."</strong></a></p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten familiar with the use of Juicebox, access the simplified version to use for this activity here: <strong><a href="http://juicebox.org/simplewis/" target="_blank">http://juicebox.org/simplewis/</a></strong>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: JuiceBox is not compatible with Internet Explorer.  Please use <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>, or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416" target="_blank">Safari</a> instead.</strong></p>

<p></p><h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>The following two options are available to complete the assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can add new power generation facilities. Icons for these new facilities will appear on the Timeline.<br>
For example, you might choose to add new wind or solar photovoltaic facilities. Note however that these facilities tend to produce electricity at higher average costs, and are not readily dispatchable to meet peak demand. A greater total capacity is therefore required to ensure that demand is met during peak periods.</li><br><br>
<li>You can retire existing generation facilities. Icons for retired facilities will appear on the Timeline, overlain by a red “X”.</li><br>
This option can be used to reduce CO2 emissions by reducing generation using fossil fuels. Note that retirement of such facilities will require addition of other facilities, in order to meet generation and peak demand requirements.
</ol>

<h4>Assignment</h4>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Modify the default simulation so that it satisfies 3 criteria in 2025:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Peak generating capacity increases to meet the specified target (dashed line)</li>
<li>CO2 emissions remain no greater than present day (dashed line)</li>
<li>Generation must continue to meet anticipated requirements (dashed line)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Modify your simulation further, to meet the more ambitious goal of decreasing CO2 emissions by approximately 50%.</p>

<h4>Discussion questions</h4>
<p>Based on what you have learned, respond to one (or both) of the following questions in the <a href=" "><strong>Unit 4 Discussion Forum</strong></a>. (You can click either of the questions to go directly to it in the discussion board.)</p>
<p><strong><a href=" ">1. What effect did your modifications have on the cost of electricity per kWh for each part of the activity? Are the new cost rates acceptable in your opinion?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=" ">2.  Based on the options available in Juicebox, what would it take to build a system entirely based on renewables, which also meets the requirement for peak capacity?</a></strong></p></div>
