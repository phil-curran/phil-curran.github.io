<h3>Hydraulic Fracturing</h3>
<p>Hydraulic fracturing requires injecting fluids into the subsurface at pressures high enough to exceed the failure strength of rocks. In order for a fracture to open, the pressures must also be high enough to overcome the confining pressure that is being exerted by the weight over overlying rocks, usually at depths of 1000 meters or more below the land surface.</p>
<p>This situation is directly analogous to inflating a balloon beneath the surface of the water in a swimming pool or bathtub. The volume of the inflated balloon represents the volume of an open fracture (although its shape may be different), and the water pressure at the depth where the balloon is inflated is analogous to the confining pressure exerted by rocks at the depth where a fracture opens.</p>
<p>For this part of the activity, you will subjectively measure the pressure required to inflate a balloon under two different conditions: at surface atmospheric pressure, and submerged beneath 50 cm of water.</p>
<h4>Materials needed:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A party balloon</li>
<li>Rubber bands, duct tape, or string</li>
<li>About 1 meter length of plastic pipe or hose</li>
<li>Filled bathtub, jacuzzi, swimming pool, or other standing body of water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Procedure:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Stretch the opening of the balloon over one end of the pipe or hose.</li>
<li>Secure the balloon to the pipe or hose end using rubber bands, tape, or string.</li>
<li>Blow into the other end of the pipe or hose, noting the amount of effort required to inflate the balloon.</li>
<li>Now submerge the balloon beneath 50 cm of water (or as deep as you can get it) and blow into the tube or hose, noting the amount of effort required to inflate the balloon.</li>
<hr>
<h4>Follow-up Questions</h4>
<p>The following questions are intended to help reinforce your own understanding of this experiment - <em>you do not need to report your answers</em>.
</p><ol>
<li>How did the effort required to inflate the balloon change between steps 3 and 4?</li>
<li>What is the approximate water pressure at 50 cm depth, relative to atmospheric pressure? <em>Note: Water pressure increases at the rate of about 1 atmosphere per 10 meters of depth.</em></li>
<li>What is the approximate pressure at 1000 meters in the Earthâ€™s crust, relative to atmospheric pressure? <em>Note: Assume that the average density of rocks is about 2.5 times that of water, so pressure increases 2.5 times as quickly with depth.</em></li>
<li>How does this compare to the maximum pressure typically found in an automobile tire? In a compressed gas cylinder?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Based on what you have learned, respond to one (or both) of the following questions in the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/earthenergy-001/forum/list?forum_id=10011"><strong>Unit 2 Discussion Forum</strong></a>. (You can click either of the questions to go directly to it in the discussion board.)</p>
<p><strong><a href=" ">1. Based on the observations you've made in this experiment, what would have to be done in order to make hydraulic fractures extend past their target horizon, to intersect a shallow freshwater aquifer lying several kilometers above? Is this scenario realistic?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=" ">2. Aside from direct contamination of aquifers by over-extended hydraulic fractures, what <em>other</em> environmental problems may arise from increased drilling of hydraulically-fractured (or conventional) oil and gas wells?</a></strong></p></ol></div>
