<h4>Shaun Marcot</h4>
<h6>Assistant Professor, Department of Geoscience, University of Wisconsin - Madison</h6>
<p>Shaun Marcott is a glacial geologist and paleoclimatologists in the Department of Geoscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research is focused on late Quaternary climate change and dating of glacial landscapes to better understand the interplay between climate and glaciers of the past in order to place modern climate-glacier interactions into a prehistorical context for understanding future changes. With a broad background in geology, oceanography, and mathematics he teaches a wide variety of subjects including introductory courses in oceanography and geology and upper level courses in paleoclimatology and glacial geology. He holds degrees in geology from Oregon State and Portland State Universities and is a native Alaskan with family members and friends in the energy industry. In addition to his research, he enjoys spending time in the outdoors with his aging golden retriever and his growing family.</p>

<h4>Tina Nielsen</h4>
<h6>Associate Director of the Great Lakes Bioenergy Resource Center - Madison, Wisconsin</h6>
<p>Tina Nielsen has held positions focused on energy since 2006. Dr. Nielsen joined the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC) as its Associate Director in 2014. Housed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, GLBRC is one of three Department of Energy funded centers dedicated to the advancement of cellulosic biofuels through basic science research. Being on the leadership team of this large research center requires a balance between internal administrative responsibilities with external government and industry relations all while keeping science at the forefront.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the GLBRC, Dr. Nielsen spent over 8 years in the energy industry primarily in a geoscience role. As a deep-water sedimentologist at BP and Conoco-Phillips, she has worked exploration and production both domestically (Gulf of Mexico and on-shore US) and internationally (Brazil). In addition to her technical responsibilities, Dr. Nielsen was very involved in university relations and recruiting leading both the University of Michigan and University of Wisconsin geoscience activities during her tenure. Prior to returning back to university for her graduate degrees, Tina was a science teacher at Marysville (MI) Intermediate School.</p>
<p>Tina holds a BS (’95), Secondary Teaching Certificate (’97) and MS (’03-Department of Geological Sciences) from the University of Michigan in addition to a PhD (’08-Department of Geology and Geophysics) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her graduate research focused on marine sedimentology and geochemistry.</p>
