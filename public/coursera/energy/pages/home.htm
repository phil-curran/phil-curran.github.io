      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Energy use and its consequences motivate some of the most contentious
        public debates of our time. These issues are intrinsically complex, and
        embody difficult tradeoffs between physical, economic, and political
        realities. All energy systems share a common dependency on finite Earth
        resources, although these dependencies may not always be apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This 4-unit course explores these issues through short video lectures,
        readings, activities, and discussions that will guide learners on an
        exploration of present and future energy systems, focusing on how the
        evolution of the Earth has shaped energy tradeoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will learn how to apply three main themes to the evaluation of any
        proposed energy solution:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Energy quality is more important than quantity. We have plenty of
          energy available; what is important is our ability to make practical
          use of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technology changes reality. The history of energy use if one of
          continuous technological innovation, which continually redefines the
          possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no free lunch. No solution is entirely “green”; any energy
          system scaled up to satisfy a significant share of our demand will
          bring economic and environmental consequences of its own.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        Each unit will include one required reading, between 5-10 short video
        lectures, a brief multiple-choice quiz, an activity, participation in
        the online discussion board, and a “Digging Deeper” list of additional
        readings and resources related to the weekly topic.

        While you can complete the materials in any order you choose, we highly
        recommend that you begin with the required reading and then watch the
        lecture videos before proceeding with the quiz and activities.

      <h4>Participation</h4>
      <p>
        You can explore and learn at your own pace, and you have the option to
        choose how to spend your time in the course. You may choose to select
        only the topics and activities that interest you the most, or you may
        choose to complete all of the work.<!--  work towards a <em>Statement of Accomplishment </em>(see below). -->

            a new thread with your own question or comment related to the
            content of the course. There is no specific word count or number of

<a name="statement"></a><h4>Statement of Accomplishment</h4>
<p>The <em>Statement of Accomplishment</em> is a recognition that you engaged with the materials in the course and have completed each of the weekly quizzes. A <em>Statement of Accomplishment</em> is electronically signed by the course instructor and includes your name, the title of the course, and a brief course description.</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">In order to receive a Statement of Accomplishment, you must successfully complete all 4 weekly quizzes and earn an overall final grade (the average of all 4 quizzes) that is <strong>greater than or equal to 70%.</strong> You will be allowed 2 attempts on each quiz, so if you wish to improve your grade after the first attempt, you can try again. Quizzes will be available until 11:59 pm CST on July 26, 2015.</p>

<h4>Discussion Ground Rules</h4>
<p>The discussion forums are meant to provide for stimulating and respectful conversations around the subject matter. Please refer to the <strong><a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/201532585-Code-of-Conduct" target="_blank">Coursera Code of Conduct</a></strong> for basic ground rules that should guide all your posts.  Beyond these basics, please also consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be concise.  Shorter, well-written posts generally get more attention and are more likely to be persuasive.</li>
<li>Avoid overtly political posts.  The aim of this course is to develop a better understanding of the physical realities of energy supply and consumption.  While public policy issues are of course important they tend to distract from the main points of the course, and purely political posts are therefore considered off limits.</li>
<li>Support your arguments with facts.  Arguments should be based on data, facts, and other evidence; rather than personal opinion.</li>
<li>Where possible, provide links out to the data, facts, or other evidence which supports your assertions.  Please note that your personal opinion alone does not constitute evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you fail to follow these guidelines within the discussion forum, we reserve the right to limit your participation in the forums in order that a respectful and constructive dialog can continue.</p>
