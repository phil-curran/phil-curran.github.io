    <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 20px; text-align:center"><em>Take a look at this world map of international branch campuses. What do you notice? </em></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Perhaps the fact that international branch campuses seem to be concentrated in particular parts of the world caught your eye—the Gulf region, China, Malaysia, or Singapore? Or maybe you noticed that dotted around the world, from South Africa to Chile
      and Canada, as well as many countries across Europe, there are smaller concentrations of branch campuses? You might also have noticed that the United States and Australia, two countries with very large numbers of international students enrolled
      in their respective graduate and undergraduate programs, appear to host very few branch campuses, though Adelaide (the capital city of South Australia), of all places, seems a curious anomaly [any Adelaideans (sp?) out there?!].</p>
    <p>We imagine you have a number of questions running around in your head. What exactly is an international branch campus (IBC)? We’ll have more to say about this later, but think, for example, about Malaysia’s <a href="http://www.limkokwing.net/botswana/about/campus"
      target="_blank">Limkokwing University Botswana</a> campus or the <a href="http://www.nottingham.edu.my/index.aspx" target="_blank">University of Nottingham, Malaysia</a>. The <a href="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Observatory on Borderless Higher Education</a>      (OBHE), that we partnered with to produce this map, defines them this way: </p>

    <!-- Box 1 -->
    <div class="well well-large pull-right" style="max-width:40%;">
      <p class="box-title muted">Box 1 – Definition of International Branch Campus
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>An international branch campus (IBC) is a type of foreign educational outpost that is established in a country other than the one where the home (primary) campus exists. It typically has a physical presence in the host country, and is at least partly
        owned by the home institution. The students can earn degrees in the name of the home institution.</p>
      <p class="source">Source: <a href="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/documents/view_details?id=894" target="_blank">OBHE, 2012</a></p>

    </div>
    <!-- end Box 1 -->

    <p>When did IBC’s first begin to appear, and why? Which universities and countries are promoting these arrangements, and why? How have the patterns evident on this map changed over time? What kind of student enrols, and why? How are branch campuses regulated,
      especially when the home institution is likely to have a very different regulatory environment from the host country? Where do the construction workers come from who build the campuses? How do these kinds of enterprises transform the landscapes
      in which they are located, and what are the consequences for host city region development more generally? </p>
    <p>These are all important questions, and ones we’ll be exploring with you, for they help us unravel the big question at the heart of this week’s class:
      <em>What do the changing spatial geometries of universities—as they press and spread down, out, and up in city, regional, and global spaces, and engage in highly complex forms of entanglement in their environment(s)—mean for the very definition of a
        university, especially for how universities are organised and governed, and for key ideas that define a university like academic freedom and university autonomy?</em>

    <p>Towns and cities have always mattered to the universities who inhabit them, and vice versa. From ancient towns in China, to medieval cities in Europe, and modern cities in geographies as diverse as North America, Australia or Latin America, universities
      make, mark, and memorialise cities, sometimes in quite spectacular fashion. </p>
    <p>Take a look at the stunning buildings of the Universidade de Brasilia, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_City" target="_blank">Qatar’s Education City</a>, which houses a number of high status universities from around the globe.&nbsp;

    <p>These architectural statements aim to communicate the importance of knowledge and learning, as well as to celebrate the development of a city or nation in which these buildings are located. </p>
    <p>But universities of all sorts, branch campuses included, are not just aesthetic statements, or status symbols of higher learning. Rather, they play an important role in their local economy and its community. They generate significant revenues as a
      result of concentrations of students and staff, are typically one of the largest employers in their environments, attract other smaller and larger firms who might collaborate with or benefit from the research activity of the university, and engage
      in diverse forms of cultural and aesthetic production that enrich the localities where they are positioned. These are all basic but very important points made by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/vco/vc/" target="_blank">Nigel Thrift</a>,
      the University of Warwick’s Vice Chancellor (see his podcast below). For many, being a modern city or nation means having a university. </p>
    <p>Yet universities’ relationships to their urban environments are complicated. Historians of the medieval university describe an often turbulent relationship between what came to be known as ‘town and gown’ as a result of the drunken and transgressive
      behavior of students. However, threats over the students leaving meant the town might lose an important source of revenues, causing the city elders to capitulate to the demands of the students. This gave students and the university considerable
      negotiating powers with the local community, with scholars often exempted from local rules, such as paying taxes. </p>

    <div style="width:50%;" class="pull-right">
      <img src="img/SiftandWinnow_thumb.jpg" class="img-polaroid">
      <p class="caption">Plaque from Bascom Hall—University of Wisconsin-Madison</p>
    </div>

    <p>As universities developed, another important dimension to the ‘idea of a university’ was that scholars should be given a degree of autonomy over their affairs so as to protect themselves, and also the university, from direct political interference.
      Academic freedom and university autonomy continue to be two key and interrelated ideas related to university governance and academic life, and arise directly out of this claim to autonomy in the pursuit of truth. See the statement on this plaque
      just outside the entrance to Bascom Hall at UW-Madison, for example, the <a href=" " target="_blank">outcome of a famous (in the US) struggle over academic freedom</a>.</p>
    <p>However, if academic freedom and self-governance are largely secured in national and sub-national legislation, then clearly there are major challenges facing universities as they both regionalise and globalise. In other words, universities that venture
      abroad may be confronted with regulatory and political challenges that are different from those in their ‘home’ spaces. Academic freedom and relative autonomy – core principles associated with the origins of the medieval university, and still critically
      important principles today, are themes that will pop up throughout this class, and in many of the other weeks of material.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Before turning our attention to global processes today, it is useful to remind ourselves that the university is one of the oldest formal education institutions, with a history that can be traced back beyond the medieval period to centres of higher
      learning&nbsp; (see Box 2 at right). This longer history is important for reminding us of the Western euro-centric views many of us hold of the history of advanced knowledge creation.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>In 2013 Susan had the opportunity to visit Hanoi, Vietnam, and was delighted to find herself in the Temple of Literature, established in 1076. The Temple of Literature was in effect Vietnam’s first university. Created to honour Confucius and to educate
      the sons of mandarins, the Temple of Literature was eventually opened to talented commoners, in the 13th Century. These students used their higher learning to advance their careers in the civil service.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>In the 15th century the practice of carving the names of the new doctors into stone plaques (stelae) which we can see rising from the backs of turtles (see image 1) was introduced. Today, some 82 stelae dot the courtyard, featuring the names of around
      1306 doctorates awarded for successful completion of demanding examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p class="source">Original photograph: Susan Robertson</p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">You’ll also notice from Box 2 that centers for higher learning have a long history in South East Asia, as well as in Egypt and Turkey, a fact that is often forgotten by modern writers on the university. Instead, they tend to start with the now-famous
      University of Bologna in Italy, which began to grant degrees in 1088. </p>
    <p>It is at this point that we see a steady expansion in the number of universities being created in European cities and beyond, which come to be known as the medieval universities. And it is degree-awarding capability, and recognition of that capability,
      which continues to define to this day which providers of higher learning can call themselves a university or not.</p>
    <p>By the beginning of the 20th Century, most regional and capital cities, at least in the Global North, housed at least one university, often with a mission tied to local and regional development as part of a national effort to improve. Many nations
      also took pride in having a national university as a flagship institution. These universities were expected to play important developmental roles nationally and regionally. </p>
    <p>Over time, the expansion and concentration of research-intensive universities in cities in the US, for example, led the scholar of higher education, <a href="http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/clarkkerr.html" target="_blank">Clarke Kerr</a>,
      to describe them in 1963 as ‘Cities of Intellect,’ making them not only strong centers of economic activity and intellectual powerhouses, but also resources for local, regional, national, and global competition. More recently, many of these well-known
      universities have sought to expand their institutional fabrics into other parts of the world via the establishment of international branch campuses in Asia and the Gulf region, as noted above, creating what might be viewed as a new phase in the
      development of the university. </p>
    <p>By anyone’s reckoning, the various developments under way, as universities engage in the latest phase of globalizing, are diverse, fast moving and very dynamic. Even the language we have typically used to talk about the university is changing, in
      part because of new initiatives, and in part because old ways of thinking are no longer able to fully grasp quite what is going on. For instance when a public university globalizes by setting up a branch campus in Asia, is it still public, or is
      it private? Many Asian governments require branch campuses to be legally owned by an incorporated private entity and they are not offered direct public subsidies. Given this, higher education regulators in Asia describe these as private and not
      public. And this is just one of the examples we can point to. What this means is that we need to push our geographical and sociological imaginations forward, and think about evolving landscapes—from urban contexts to new virtual spaces—and the structural
      agendas that are reshaping the relationship between universities and the places which they inhabit. </p>
    <p>One relationship that is particularly important to consider is the one between the university and the city-region, which is changing as a result of the pressure on universities to become new kinds of powerhouses for the economy. How do cities engage
      with universities newly called to be engines for regeneration and city development, beacons in the competition for global talent, or magnets for investment to invigorate local economies and cities?

      <div class="arrowhead"></div>
    </div><!-- end arrow -->

    <p>There are two key structural changes with respect to the urban context that we’d like you to think about. The first is that of global urbanization, and the second is that of the concentration of power in select cities, specifically those that scholars
      like <a href="http://www.saskiasassen.com/" target="_blank">Saskia Sassen</a> have deemed ‘global cities.’</p>
    <p>Urbanization, the process of development that relocates an increasingly significant proportion of human activity to state-defined “urban” from “rural” areas, has been underway for hundreds of years, with significant differences across space and time.
      In the last decade or so, we’ve entered the era of ‘global urbanization’—one where the majority of the world’s population now lives in ‘urban’ areas. This is a complicated and evolving development process, but one that is readily visible in this
      series of maps (see Figures 1-4 below) from the United Nations’

    <p>This transition raises both opportunities and challenges for higher education systems and institutions, especially since most are fixed in space, often in inner city or inner suburban areas, and expect students to come to their campuses. And yet urbanists
      like <a href="http://fes.yorku.ca/faculty/fulltime/profile/5206" target="_blank">Roger Keil</a>, <a href="http://www.iar.ubc.ca/introduction/tmcgee.html" target="_blank">TG McGee</a>, <a href="http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/faculty/roy_ananya/" target="_blank">Ananya Roy</a>,
      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deyan_Sudjic" target="_blank">Deyan Sudjic</a> have pointed out that we are seeing not just the growth of the proportion of the world’s population living in cities, but also the emergence of new spatial
      patterns and orders as a result. These are associated with more dispersed, and therefore less dense, concentrations of people than in older denser urban areas.</p>
    <p>This emerging pattern is associated with terms like ‘sprawl’, ‘extended metropolitan regions’, ‘exurbs’, ‘edge cities’, ‘borderless cities’, ‘megapolitan areas’, ‘megalopolises’, the '100 Mile City,' and the like. There are some important differences
      between these terms and their origins, some of which go back many decades. For the purposes of this class, we’ll leave the differences aside for a moment and focus on patterns of similarity. </p>

    <p>The second urban condition worth taking note of, at a global level, is the emergence of global cities. Global cities have themselves become a major object of research. For our purposes here, we want to focus on the role of global cities—such as London,
      New York, Barcelona or Hong Kong—in acting as ‘key basing points’ for transnational corporate headquarters. In doing so, global cities become embedded within global circuits of capital, both facilitating and reflecting the material and symbolic
      power of global capital. In other words, global cities play key strategic roles in servicing global capital through agglomeration effects, a point well made by the urbanist, <a href="http://www.saskiasassen.com/" target="_blank">Saskia Sassen</a>,
      who suggests in
      <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6943.html" target="_blank">
        <em>The Global City</em>
      </a>
      <em> (2011, </em>3-4) that:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[A] combination of spatial dispersal and global integration has created a new strategic role for major cities. Beyond their long history as centres for international trade and banking, these cities now function as centres in four new ways: first,
        as highly concentrated command points in the organization of the world economy; second, as key locations for finance and specialized service firms, which have replaced manufacturing as the leading economic sectors; third, as sites of production
        of innovations, in these leading industries; and fourth, as markets for the products and innovations produced. These changes in the functioning of cities have had a massive impact upon both international economic activity and urban form: cities
        concentrate control over vast resources, while finance and specialized service industries have restructured the urban social and economic order. Thus a new type of city has appeared. It is the global city (2001: 3-4).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In short, global cities are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>command points in the organisation of the world economy;</li>
      <li>key locations and marketplaces for the leading industries of the current period, which are finance and specialised services for firms; and</li>
      <li>major sites of production for these industries, including the production of innovations &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book234999" target="_blank">Sassen, 1994: 4</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are also variants on the idea of a global city: so called ‘gateway cities’, like Melbourne or Vancouver, play key gateway (duh!) functions for material and non-material flows of goods, services, people, ideas, and so on, without necessarily
      playing the command and control functions a global city plays. As an example, Vancouver is
      <em>not</em> a very powerful finance or corporate headquarters city, but it
      <em>is</em> a globally significant point of entry for migrants (permanent and temporary) and tourists, increasingly from East Asia (see the important work on Vancouver’s roiling immigration situation by researchers in the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/"

    <p>What the gateway function can do is alter the complexion of universities, whether they plan it or not. The University of British Columbia (UBC) of today is very different than it was when one of us (Kris) attended it as an undergraduate, when it looked
      East and North vs. West to Asia. However, as UBC’s <a href="http://www.research.ubc.ca/vpri/executive-profiles" target="_blank">John Hepburn</a> point out in the podcast to the left, an over-dependence on East Asia can also be a problem, and the
      university is considering reviewing its internationalising strategy to include other countries, such as Brazil, to ensure there is not an over-dependence on particular ‘gateway’ populations. This said, it’s worth noting that UBC is using the gateway-related
      demographic transformation in Vancouver, as well as its high quality of life, to underlie its continued development of high quality/impact research capacity on East Asian (especially Chinese) development issues, some of which are politically sensitive.</p>

    <p>Hepburn’s comments are also worth relating back to last week’s topic of globalizing universities.</p>
    <p>Given these externally-driven dynamics, gateway and especially global cities have become associated with volatile economies, dense nodes of information and social networks, social polarisation, globalised property markets, social diversity (through
      migration in particular), cosmopolitanism, a complex of higher education institutions, creativity, vibrancy, and also considerable human suffering as these dynamics produce growing inequalities within the cityscape. These cities are thus the visible
      manifestation of the global economy. In fact, according to Sassen and other <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/" target="_blank">global city researchers</a> and consultants like <a href="http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/UserFiles/File/Globalmidwest/2012_Global_Cities_Index.pdf"
      target="_blank">AT Kearney</a>, some 30-40 cities play an outsized role in holding together the entire world system.</p>
    <p>Not surprisingly, global cities like New York, London, Paris and Tokyo are associated with a disproportionate number of globally-ranked universities. They have also, more recently, become target cities for many non-global city universities via the
      mechanisms we discussed in Week 1 (Globalizing Universities). These cities tend to be associated with complex inter-city networks of universities like the <a href="http://alliance.columbia.edu/about-us" target="_blank">The Alliance Program</a>,
      “a non-profit transatlantic joint-venture” between New York-based Columbia University and three “prestigious” Paris-based institutions: the École Polytechnique, Sciences Po, and Panthéon-Sorbonne University.”

    <p>Over the past one to two decades, universities have become linked much more closely to the knowledge economy agenda. For rentier states, such as Saudi Arabia, this means investing in building universities from scratch, where, in some cases, there
      has been no history of higher learning. By building up a higher education sector, these Arab states hope to protect themselves from an over-dependence on oil revenues, on the one hand, and to develop research and innovation capacity to help them
      solve pressing sustainability issues such as water engineering, on the other.&nbsp;

    <p>By way of contrast, Singapore has turned to the development of a regional hub for higher education with the explicit purpose of building up its knowledge/innovation base to enable it to overcome its lack of natural resources. In the cities where we
      both live—Bristol and Madison—the local universities have been challenged to look at new ways to develop relationships with industry. By learning what problems local industry is confronting, we are told, the university can better turn its research
      capacity toward developing practical innovations that might also in turn create value for the university, the local economy and the nation.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Yet invoking an innovation agenda does not necessarily produce innovation. Why? Because ‘innovation’ is an unruly process that has long stumped analysts and advocates. Indeed, there is a veritable cottage industry of scholars who work on universities
      and innovation, innovation systems, innovation networks, and associated phenomena. This agenda intersects with higher education systems, institutions and practices in a variety of ways, including the development of research and advocacy programs
      regarding university industry linkages, entrepreneurship, technology transfer, the role of higher education institutions (HEIs) in R&amp;D, the role of HEIs in city-region development, online education (most recently), and so on.</p>
    <p>But how does this agenda intersect with the agenda for the globalization of higher education and research? Well, in a wide variety of ways, especially given the globalizing nature of economies and societies. Researchers who focus on all of the above
      phenomena are increasingly grappling with the impact of ‘global pipelines’ guiding flows of people and information between multiple sites; transnational flows of mobile people, technologies, and venture capital; and multi-sited epistemic communities
      that produce the jointly authored publications <a href="http://globalhighered.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/beauchesnemap1.jpg" target="_blank">mapped here</a>. </p>

    </div>
    <!-- end arrow -->
    <h3 class="section-subtitle">Movements ‘down’, ‘out’ and ‘up’</h3>

    <p>As the sociospatial structures of cities are changing, so too are the sociospatial structures of universities as they respond to innovation agendas elsewhere, to new sources of funding, to the opportunities to absorb excess demand for places, and
      so on. In short, universities are now in motion again, taking new development paths and generating quite distinct global patterns that depart quite significantly in shape, form, and logic from the medieval university. </p>
    <p>We’ve found it helpful to view these different spatial strategies and trajectories as
      <strong>
        <em>movements</em>
      </strong> taking place ‘down’, ‘out’, and ‘up’. </p>
    <p>By
      <strong>
        <em>movements</em>
        <em>downward</em>,</strong> we mean university projects that aim at re/connecting, often in new ways, with the place in which their university is located. In some cases this occurs through the return to the historic mission of the university: to connect
      with, and service, the local economy. In other cases, movements downward engage with local communities to ensure relevance to local firms and communities, a point made very clearly by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Warwick</a>      Vice Chancellor, Nigel Thrift, in the podcast below. Universities are also conscious that place matters to students, and that when place is part of the global marketing strategy, then delivering on ‘place’ (safety, facilities, transport and so on)
      means engaging with the city to ensure these things are being properly addressed.</p>

        <em>movements outwards</em>
      </strong> we mean initiatives and connections that stretch out into global space and connect with new places well beyond the nation-state. This can take the form of extending into an outpost, such as a branch campus (ranging from one department to a whole
      suite of programs) in a host country (see, for example, the Qatar Foundation’s ‘<a href="http://www.myeducationcity.com/" target="_blank">Education City’</a> or the <a href="http://www.kv.ae/">Dubai Knowledge Village</a> in Dubai, Arab Emirates);
      the development of a stand-alone campus, such as <a href="http://www.monash.edu.my/" target="_blank">Monash University, Malaysia</a> or Nottingham University’s <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/about/campuses/chinacampus.aspx" target="_blank">China Campus Ningbo</a>;
      the development of consortia, such as <a href="http://www.universitas21.com/" target="_blank">Universitas 21</a> or the <a href="http://www.wun.ac.uk/" target="_blank">World Universities Network</a>, which connect universities together across the
      globe, often around grand challenges; or new regional initiatives, such as the European Higher Education Area or Mercosur (which we develop in Week 4 when we look at Regions).&nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are various reasons for these movements outward, but a major one is securing new sources of revenue for the home institution and positioning the university globally in a highly competitive and increasingly volatile arena. The race to establish
      institutional alliances also serves a host of economic and diplomatic purposes for partner institutions and their host countries as part of an expanding web of global convergences. Finally, outward movements enable universities to jump scale and
      connect to innovation systems associated with other city-regions. Scale and cost are frequent topics; capacity and long-term sustainability are less so.&nbsp; </p>

      <strong>
        <em>movement upward</em>
      </strong> we mean the building from scratch of universities which, in some cases at least, seem to almost literally pop up overnight, particularly when we consider how long it takes for a fully-fledged university with large teaching and research capability
      to be established. Examples here include the creation of a new $13 billion university in Saudi Arabia, <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/" target="_blank">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</a> (KAUST), which we profile below; the
      proposed <a href="http://www.nycedc.com/project/applied-sciences-nyc" target="_blank">Applied SciencesNYC </a>, currently under development and which we also profile below; the <a href="http://www.unila.edu.br/" target="_blank">Universidade Federal da Integração Latino-Americana</a>,
      otherwise know as UNILA, currently being developed to service students around the Latin American region and create a Latin American knowledge base for its disciplines; and <a href="http://nu.edu.kz/portal/faces/main?_afrLoop=536126593023056&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=un14bdzsc_4"
      target="_blank">Nazarbayev University</a>, Kazakhstan, which we also profile in this class. The scale of this approach varies, from exclusive partnerships between an established university and a start-up (e.g. MIT with <a href="http://www.skoltech.ru/en/"
      target="_blank">Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology</a> outside Moscow) to multi-partner collaborations between already-existing universities (the National University of Singapore) with Yale, Johns Hopkins, Duke, NYU, ETH Zurich, and MIT.
      </p>
    <p>In truth, however, for many universities experimenting with global positioning and developments, these movements down, out, and up tend to be multiply deployed. But in considering them this way, we get a sense not only of the diverse spatial strategies
      being pursued (down, out, up), but also of their implications for what universities do (teaching/research/enterprise). These new global and regional formations require new techniques of governance, especially when they involve distance or new corporate
      partners, with consequences for staff who work in these new kinds of spaces. This brings us back, then, to self-governance and academic freedom. </p>
    <h3>Movements
      <em>outward</em>: Nazarbayev University’s hybrid model</h3>
    <p>
      <em> [This case is based upon a report by <a href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/rensimer/web/" target="_blank">Lee Rensimer</a> (a project assistant in the quality assurance working group for the UW-Madison - Nazarbayev University partnership at Wisconsin-Madison)

    </p>
    <p>Originally conceived as the New University of Astana, <a href="http://nu.edu.kz/portal/faces/main" target="_blank">Nazarbayev University</a> (NU) was given its presidential namesake in the early developmental stages when its vision as a national university
      dramatically expanded to a world class-aspiring research flagship. Modeling itself on elite American universities, it brings together top international programs and faculty, state-of-the-art research facilities, and predominantly Kazakh students
      in an English-speaking environment. As Kazakhstan aims to diversify its economic output and shift towards knowledge-intensive industries, NU is positioning itself to be the nation’s engine for innovation by producing its future researchers, intelligentsia
      and knowledge economy workers. </p>
    <p>NU has eight high-profile international partners, each contracted to attend to one of NU’s academic domains:</p>

    <p>Within each sub-contracted domain, NU’s partners bring their experience and expertise in academic programs, providing the scaffolding for (or facsimiles of) their home departments’ degree program policies, governance and course credit structures.
      Faculty are sourced through these partners with some variation (UW-Madison is currently shifting from the use of international faculty hiring committees to localized NU-based recruiting, while Duke continues to conduct its interviews from its home
      campus in Durham, North Carolina).&nbsp; However, all are employed by NU and are governed by its teaching and research requirements.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The Graduate School of Education is shared between Cambridge and University of Pennsylvania, one attending to K-12 and the other to higher education, while University College London also oversees the Center for Preparatory Studies, the university’s
      first-year foundational program that prepares students for study in English and their chosen fields.&nbsp; Each of these partners was approached by an ad hoc team of Kazakh higher education leaders in 2009 with the full coalition solidifying shortly
      thereafter.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>As one might imagine, the mixture of diverse international partners under a single roof inevitably leads to tensions between the institutional, academic and professional practices of the host and partner countries.</p>
    <h4 class="light">Conflicting institutional practices</h4>
    <p>Not surprisingly, the eight partners from three international contexts have a multiplicity of institutional practices and systems, which often conflict with one another and preclude cross-institutional compatibility. While U.S.-based partners implemented
      degree programs based on the 3-credit-per-course Carnegie standard, U.K. partners imported their 15-credit modules with different standard of class-hour commitments. These differences have been a considerable challenge to the aim of standardizing
      across institutions and acquiring external accreditation.</p>
    <p>A further tension concerns course length. Based on the American model, NU undergraduate programs are four-year courses. The engineering program was intended to be borrowed from University College London (UCL). However that program requires only three
      years, plus a two-year externship for state certification. Not having such a certification procedure in the Kazakh context, UCL’s team at NU had to improvise a fourth year of instruction to fill the gap.</p>
    <p>The Graduate School of Education, which pairs Cambridge with the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), has also had to merge two divergent models of faculty governance in one school.&nbsp; UPenn has traditionally maintained a more decentralized system
      of institutional policymaking in line with the American model, while Cambridge brought its more hierarchical approach to NU, creating a set of challenges for the NU school’s first dean.</p>
    <h4 class="light">Issues of trust between host and partner institutions</h4>
    <p>Due to the high stakes of some end-of-year exams (the UK model, particularly), some exams are being developed off-site without the involvement of any faculty in order to minimize opportunities for academic malpractice. In a major incident this year,
      exams being stored on campus were breached by determined students through the bribing of cleaning staff, resulting in the test scores being nullified and exams rescheduled in the subsequent semester.</p>
    <p>The sharp contrast in salary offers between international faculty and local Kazakh hires is causing tensions, leading to the need for unusual secrecy around teaching expenditures. Unlike the governance model of U.S. institutions, department chairs
      and deans are prohibited from knowing their own faculties’ salaries because of the public outcry which would result if the figures were ever made public.</p>
    <h4 class="light">Tensions between international aims and national prerogatives</h4>
    <p>As a national university, NU is also beholden to the political imperatives of the Kazakh national leadership and Ministry of Higher Education. One such imperative is the push for more Kazakh-relevant learning outcomes to consolidate national identity.
      Recent national educational policymaking has required that NU graduates develop Kazakh citizenship skills, Kazakh language proficiency, and knowledge of Kazakh culture and history. This is an issue unique to embedded institutional partnerships (this
      presumably would not be an issue in autonomous market-based IBC models).</p>
    <p>Due to the shortage of qualified, English-fluent Kazakh academics who match NU’s and partner institutions’ standards of excellence, the NU faculty is currently dominated by foreign academics. This has led to tensions between NU’s immediate hiring
      needs and local employment demands. It has also produced an oversupply of recruiting in some fields and undersupplies in others.</p>
    <p>These are only a few of the varied and ongoing challenges that the hybrid partnership model presents in the NU case. For all the troubles in this approach, it potentially yields important long-term rewards. In addition to the immediate expertise its
      partners provide, NU is networked with eight of the world’s elite universities, enabling pipelines for talent, research collaborations, consultation, and prestige by association. A gilded stepladder to the ranks of world-class universities, all
      while maintaining institutional autonomy and (some) national character, is no small payoff, particularly for long-term sustainability prospects. The hefty costs, to the tune of multi-million dollar annual contracts with partners, are borne up front,
      while Kazakhstan maintains sovereignty over its national flagship. And NU is now beginning to move downwards, and explore its ideal strategy to further the city-region development process and construct a new regional innovation system.</p>
    <h3>Movements
      <em>upward</em>: Saudi Arabia, KAUST, and the ‘House of Wisdom’</h3>
    <p>
      <em>[This case is based on an October 2009 <a href="http://globalhighered.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/the-kaust-inauguration/" target="_blank">report</a> by Kimberly Coulter for the GlobalHigherEd weblog – and we want to thank her for the opportunity to
        profile her account of KAUST]</em>
    </p>
    <p> In an atmosphere of spectacular fanfare and intense security, Saudi Arabia inaugurated its new <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/" target="_blank">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a> on 23 September 2009. The US$12.5 billion
      dollar university is a gated compound on the Red Sea coast in the province of Mecca, approximately 50 miles north of Jeddah. As Saudi Arabia’s first and only co-educational university, KAUST aims to relax the social taboo of gender mixing as it
      aims to catapult the Kingdom onto the international playing field of developing knowledge-based economies. </p>

    <p>To execute his vision for a world-class research university, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud turned to <a href="http://www.saudiaramco.com/irj/portal/anonymous" target="_blank">Saudi Aramco</a>, the state-owned
      oil corporation. Aramco is experienced with research management, technology transfer, and attracting talented foreigners to extraterritorial compounds within the Kingdom. King Abdullah compares KAUST to the House of Wisdom, the great Baghdad research
      and education center of the Islamic Golden Age, situating the new university in the context of Islamic scientific achievement and regional welfare. Inaugural President Choon Fong Shih likes to call KAUST “Stanford by the Sea.” </p>

    <p>While the House of Wisdom scholars concerned themselves with topics from physics to philosophy, KAUST is not a comprehensive university. Rather, it concentrates on <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/research/centers/intro.html" target="_blank">nine science and engineering areas</a>      expected to help Saudi Arabia (and Saudi Aramco) diversify beyond oil. Its research will also have practical applications, such as water desalination, pollution remediation, the genetic engineering of more drought-tolerant plants, and the development
      of stable and cost-effective solar cells. Research breakthroughs and the transfer of these new technologies to regional companies are expected to lead to economic growth and high-paying jobs. </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;" class="light">International partnerships</h4>
    <p>Thanks to a phenomenal endowment exceeding US$10 billion, KAUST has succeeded in enlisting prestigious partners from around the world. &nbsp;All KAUST research was initially incubated in the context of international partnerships. </p>
    <p>KAUST’s <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/research/grc/aa.html?submenuheader=2" target="_blank">Academic Excellence Alliance</a> program provided roughly $25 million to foreign universities (Berkeley, Cambridge, Stanford, University of Texas at Austin,
      and Imperial College London) to advise KAUST on hiring and curricula. In addition to supporting researchers based on its campus, KAUST also provided generous grants to researchers abroad, with expectations of collaboration and participation in researcher
      and student exchanges with KAUST. </p>
    <p>Its <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/research/grc/grp.html?submenuheader=2" target="_blank">Global Research Partnership</a> granted up to $25 million over five years support centers at <a href="http://kaust-cu.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell</a>,
      <a href="http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/occam" target="_blank">Oxford</a>, <a href="http://camp.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford</a>, and <a href="http://iamcs.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M</a>, and three other “centers-in-development.” KAUST
      also funded individual investigators’ research projects with grants of $10 million each. These professors were expected to visit KAUST each year for three weeks to three months.</p>
    <p>In addition to linking its external grants to researcher exchange, KAUST is also using scholarships to develop human capital for the region. While the Kingdom has long sent talented Saudi students abroad to study, it can now attract foreign students
      as well, a long-term investment expected to yield a global network of industry and government leaders with ties to Saudi Arabia. </p>
    <h4 class="light">Recruiting talented students and faculty</h4>
    <p>KAUST counts on first-rate infrastructure to attract students and researchers. The <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/admissions/admissionsfaqs.html" target="_blank">KAUST Discovery Scholarship</a> provides all students with paid housing, travel, and
      generous stipends. KAUST offers faculty competitive salaries (estimated at 1.5 to 2 times US salaries, tax-free, plus many benefits), and—perhaps more importantly—generous multi-year research grants. It was not only research and funding that attracted
      many to KAUST, but also the chance to study in an internationally rich context. KAUST’s library provides access to a very large number of journals and online databases, interlibrary loan services, and a wide selection of general interest books.
      </p>
    <h4 class="light">Culture and gender issues</h4>
    <p>Many observers are excited about the opening of Saudi Arabia’s first university that allows men and women to interact directly. All other Saudi universities are single-sex. When women are taught by male professors, contact is technologically mediated.
      A coeducational foundation was undeniably necessary for KAUST to engage prestigious foreign partners and compete for talent internationally, yet some Saudi-based critics object to KAUST’s relaxation of this social taboo. Other critics simply doubt
      that Saudi Arabia’s students and staff, trained in a secondary education system that emphasizes learning by rote, will be prepared for the demands of a modern, world-class research university. How will the Western academic model transfer into Saudi
      Arabia’s restrictive social context? </p>
    <p>Yet, already, KAUST is a remarkable achievement. It gives the striking impression that, in Saudi Arabia, rapid change is possible, though the powerful forms of backing are clearly needed. One of the most important legacies of the House of Wisdom,
      as Jonathan Lyons explains in his <a href="http://www.jonathanlyonsportfolio.com/writing/keypoints.html" target="_blank">book</a>, is “the notion that religion and science, faith and reason, could coexist.” </p>
    <h3>Movements
      <em>down, out </em>and
      <em>up</em>: Applied Sciences NYC</h3>
    <p>One of the more fascinating efforts at unsettling the university-territory relationship and kick-starting innovation is unfolding in New York City. In this case we see three movements (down, out, up) simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Just over three years ago, in December 2010, New York City stirred up interest in higher education circles around the world with the issue of a Request for Expressions of Interest seeking “Responses from the Academic World for a Partnership with the
      City to Create a State-of-the-Art Applied Science Campus.” As the 16 December 2010 <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2010b%2Fpr512-10.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1"
      target="_blank">press release</a> put it:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Robert K. Steel and New York City Economic Development Corporation President Seth W. Pinsky today announced that the City is seeking responses from a university, applied science organization
        or related institution to develop and operate an
        <strong>applied sciences</strong> research facility in New York City. In order to maintain a diverse and competitive economy, and capture the considerable growth occurring within the science, technology and research fields, the City is looking to strengthen
        its applied sciences capabilities, particularly in fields which lend themselves to commercialization. The City will make a capital contribution, in addition to possibly providing land and other considerations, commensurate with the respondent’s
        investment.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As implied above, the term “applied sciences” is a slippery one, but it typically means the application of the sciences (e.g., physics, computer science) towards the development of new inventions and knowledge, often for commercial purposes.</p>

    <p>Now, take a look at a section of the proposal in Box 4; in doing so, wear the hat of the university you know best –
      <em>are these stated goals and urban conditions attractive to your university, such that it would seek to become involved in this initiative? If so, why? If not, why not?</em>
    </p>

    <p>As it happened, conditions were attractive enough for many universities to apply.</p>
    <p>On 31 October 2011, the City of New York issued a follow-up <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr387-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1"
      target="_blank">press release</a> noting that the City had received 7 full proposals put together by these 17 HEIs. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amity University (Governor’s Island)</li>
      <li>Carnegie Mellon University/Steiner Studios (Brooklyn Navy Yard)</li>
      <li>Columbia University (Manhattanville)</li>
      <li>Cornell University/Technion-Israel Institute of Technology (Roosevelt Island)</li>
      <li>New York University/University of Toronto/University of Warwick (UK)/The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay/City University of New York and Carnegie Mellon (Downtown Brooklyn)</li>
      <li>New York Genome Center/Mount Sinai School of Medicine/Rockefeller University/SUNY Stony Brook (Midtown Manhattan)</li>
      <li>Stanford University/City College of New York (Roosevelt Island)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The brackets specify which part of NYC the universities would like to establish a new presence.</p>
    <p>Now pause and take a closer look at the geographies of these HEIs. How does this list differ from the line-up of universities that responded to the December 2010 call? Note that each proposal crafted plans to “develop and operate a new or expanded
      campus in the City in exchange for access to City-owned land and up to $100 million in City capital.”</p>
    <h4 class="light">The Winning Proposal—Cornell University (with Technion-Israel Institute of Technology)</h4>
    <p>By mid-December 2011, a decision was made that one proposal (put together by Cornell University in partnership with Technion-Israel Institute of Technology) would get initial formal go-ahead. The image below comes from the winning proposal, and is
      supplied courtesy of Cornell University.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">While there has been significant coverage of this news story, this 19 December 2011 <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr444-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1"
      target="_blank">press release</a> remains the best summary of the project’s first phase. </p>
    <p>Now, these movements—
      <em>out</em> (to NYC),
      <em>down</em> (into NYC’s high tech sector), and
      <em>up</em> (in renderings, at least)—reflect a desire to rework, quite fundamentally, the relationship between universities and territory. </p>
    <p>First, we note the state’s objective to diversify the nature of the labor market in New York, and in particular to add breadth and depth to the high-tech sector so as to counterbalance the city’s (in)famous financial services sector. </p>
    <p>Second, we can see universities expressing a desire to reach out across space and into the global city of New York. This city is a key node in the global knowledge economy, and a presence there, ideally backed by the City of New York, was attractive
      enough to embark upon a complex and risky venture. </p>
    <p>And third, the local state is seeking to unsettle the complex of universities in NYC. Importing new players, or supporting the transformation of small-time players into big ones, is part of the logic of this type of up-movement agenda, as we will
      discover in Week 7 on Singapore. </p>
    <p>Since the December 2011 announcement, we’ve seen the realization of many of NYC’s original goals, especially with respect to the Cornell-Technion initiative (see Box 5).</p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align:center">
      <em>All told, there are four Applied Sciences NYC initiatives in development.
        <br>This is quite the project, and a work in progress.</em>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Now, in grappling with the territorial unsettlings inspired by the draw of the global city of New York,
      <em>Applied Sciences NYC </em>is noteworthy, because it is generative of the formation of
      <em>deep partnerships</em> between universities from different countries, but in a new (third) setting. In so doing, universities have no choice but to forge deep and relatively trusting relations, thereby going beyond traditional international partnerships
      that are all too often associated with Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) with little follow-up.</p>
    <p>In the case of <a href="http://tech.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell NYCTech</a>, the creation of a partnership node can be opened up, at will, to new partners, while also serving as a prospective site of engagement between Cornell and Technion’s
      existing partners in the US, Israel, and abroad. This is, indeed, the value of drawing in universities like Technion and Cornell. Thus, the new campus could, in theory, serve as a site of research, teaching, and collaboration more generally, for
      the many universities that Cornell and Technion trust and respect.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, because the campus is new and its mandate is broad, at least according to the original New York City RFP, new teaching and research programs based there are likely to have significantly more latitude than they otherwise might. In short,
      creating some distance from the origin sites of all involved universities is helping break free from established practices and unwritten codes of convention on their main campuses, for good and bad. The creation of institutional spaces might also
      allow these universities and their partners, many not originally based in the city of New York, to identify and work more intensely with New York-based partners in the public, private, and non-profit worlds. The abundance of international organizations,
      NGOs, and non-profits in the city of New York cannot help but be a huge resource to these two universities, especially if they are cognizant of the importance of viewing 'innovation' broadly so as to include high social impact agendas that are not
      always associated with commercialization.</p>
    <p>The creation of striking physical presences in New York has the potential to forge informal relations of trust and interdependency with city-based actors (be they US or foreign). This is, for example, one of the benefits reaped by <a href="http://www.insead.edu/home/"
      target="_blank">INSEAD</a> after it established a deep presence in the global city of Singapore in 2001 [we’ll discuss this issue in Week 7]. The unruly processes associated with innovation often take time: they often occur by accident, serendipitously.
      As is frequently noted in research on innovation systems, serendipity may be best facilitated, if indeed it can be facilitated, via proximity and territorial co-presence. </p>
    <p>These are just a few aspects of the development process that come to mind. Can you think of some others worth noting? And yes, we realize we’re profiling some relatively well-resourced universities in a key global city. Clearly, this story is not
      a typical one! But in our minds the
      <em>Applied Sciences NYC</em> experiment is much more significant than even its advocates realize: this is a long-term experiment in reconfiguring the university-territory relationship. And don’t rush to judgment too quickly, either: as a fascinating
      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html" target="_blank">article </a>about Bell Labs in the
      <em>New York Times</em> reminds us, ‘true innovation’ takes time, and while revolutions happen fast, they ‘dawn slowly.’ </p>

    <div class="arrow sectionheader" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <div class="arrow_body" style="width: 340px;">
        <h2>New Frictions...and all that!</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="arrowhead"></div>
    </div>
    <!-- end arrow -->

    <p>By now your head is likely spinning with the ambition, scale, and pace of the changes that are reshaping universities, their city-regions, academic work, student learning, and what it means to produce knowledge. These new initiatives are also being
      driven by quite a different set of metaphors (‘hot spots’, ‘hubs’, ‘edu-city’, ‘triple-helix’, and so on) than those that guided the development of the medieval university (ivory tower). And we’ve not even included a discussion of the less downward
      movement-oriented (<a href="http://u15.ca/what-we-are-thinking/universities-era-non-lieux" target="_blank">non-place?</a>) universities—the on-line, for-profit, higher education providers (such as <a href="http://laureate.net/" target="_blank">Laureate International Universities</a>,
      <a href="http://www.kaplaninternational.com/" target="_blank">Kaplan</a>, or <a href="http://www.apolloglobal.us/" target="_blank">Apollo Global</a>), or the providers with smaller offices scattered through metropolises around the world, reflecting
      their ability to identify and serve (and sometimes create) new demographic segments of society.</p>
    <p>But setting the university into motion in global (urban) space does not mean the end of old frictions. Rather, in extending down, out, and up in globalizing city-regions, new kinds of frictions are emerging, particularly around the articulation of
      the missions of universities, the objectives of the state vis a vis territorial development, and the intra-institutional practices and principles associated with the work of faculty, students, and staff. </p>
    <p>In short, there are patterns and structural forces driving city-regions to universities, and universities to city-regions: the development process, though, unfolds in unique ways over time and space. It’s for this reason that we’ve added a detailed
      city-region case study in Week 7, where we’ll really get to take a close-up view on how all these forces, agendas, and players, come together, or not. In the end, it is in specific places that the ‘the idea of a university,’ even in a globalizing
      era, gets brought to life. </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Option A: Is higher education fit for the global urban era? On spatial-organizational strategies for serving the world’s (urban) majority</h3>
      <p>Our era of ‘global urbanization’ — one where the <a href="http://esa.un.org/unup/pdf/WUP2011_Highlights.pdf" target="_blank">majority of the world’s population now lives in ‘urban’ areas</a> – raises some interesting opportunities and challenges
        for higher education systems and institutions. In particular, as people around the world are moving to cities, cities themselves are spreading out and becoming less dense. This emerging pattern is associated with terms like sprawl, extended metropolitan
        regions, exurbs, edge cities, borderless cities, megapolitan areas, megalopolises, mega-urban regions, and the <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_100_Mile_City.html?id=KRdqAAAAIAAJ" target="_blank">’100 Mile City</a>’. Moreover,
        one of the underlying arguments of this week’s text is that in our global urban future, city-regions will matter more and more to national and regional economies, and the global economy as a whole. See this recent article (‘<a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2014/01/why-big-cities-matter-developing-world/6025/"
        target="_blank">Why Big Cities Matter in the Developing World</a>’) in
        <em>The Atlantic</em>, for example, and this “urban productivity ratio” map, which compares the “per capita economic output of metros to the per capita economic output of their nations”: </p>

      <p>But higher education cannot easily adapt to these new socio-spatial orders, at least in its ‘bricks-and-mortar’ incarnation, for it is relatively
        <em> fixed in place </em>and arguably slow to grow and adapt. In the context of such a major global structural change, can we really carry on assuming that people should physically come to
        <em>a</em> centrally located campus to receive all or a majority of their formal higher education? We think not, though feel free to disagree. </p>
      <p>Now, if city-regions are getting larger and larger, and mattering more and more to society and economy, how do we ensure our higher education systems and institutions better serve the world’s urban majority?Two of many options include: </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Higher education funders and providers progressively adjusting institutional infrastructures, pedagogical practices, and broad ways of operating, to better serve people IN PLACES, rather than drawing people to A PLACE? This could occur via mobile
          learning facilities (e.g., ‘<a href="http://registrarism.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/france-invents-the-pop-up-campus/" target="_blank">pop-up campuses</a>’), or the creation and dispersal of a plethora of basic (to keep costs down) buildings for
          teaching served by
          <em>mobile faculty</em> that would reduce the mobility responsibilities currently concentrated on students. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>More seriously supporting online learning. On this latter note, perhaps this is why some of the private for-profit sector (often online, or more basic facilities) providers have grown so quickly in many city-regions and countries in that they
          are structurally required (given their for-profit nature) to serve students wherever they are, and as efficiently as possible, first and foremost.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short
        <em>, what spatial-organizational strategies and practices need to be designed and implemented by the higher education sector to better serve the world’s (urban) majority?</em> Please discuss with reference to actual examples and/or hypothetical scenarios.
        And if you need a kick-start, also think about last week’s discussion about models and mechanisms for globalizing universities, as well as the case studies in Week 2 above.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Option B: Is higher education fit for the global urban&nbsp;era? On spatial-organizational strategies for accessing, embedding in, and engaging with global cities</h3>

      <p>As noted above, global cities, and the archipelago of global cities that are playing key roles as nodes where the forces of ‘globalization’ are constituted and managed, are also mattering more and more to societies and economies. These are not ordinary
        cities – they are extraordinary cities in that they are critically important spaces of knowledge production and control. This is, as we argued, the reason Cornell University (with Technion), and Warwick University, reached out across space to
        deepen their relationship with New York City. This is also why Amsterdam University College was established in a manner that reflects its diverse global city base, as is captured in its motto
        <em>Excellence and Diversity in a Global City</em>. And this is why, if you head back to the top of this week’s material and look at the branch campus map, you will see what is a very city-centric map.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Let’s be realistic, though – few of the world’s 14,000+ higher education institutions have the resources available to a Technion, a Cornell, an Amsterdam University College, a New York University, a Warwick University. This comment applies to universities
        worldwide, in the Global South and the Global North.</p>

      <p>Your challenge is to devise a realistic strategy to enable resource constrained universities to deepen their research and teaching/learning presence in powerful and often expensive global cities like Shanghai, Singapore, New York, Chicago, Cape
        Town, Toronto, etc. One option of many is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Universities from one city-region and or regional consortia collectively developing and running collective educational and research spaces in a distant global city. Imagine, for example, a collectively owned and developed structure modeled on
          the wonderful <a href="http://www.alliancefrancaise.org.sg/" target="_blank">Alliance Française de Singapour</a> building, and placing it in Mumbai or New York or Boston or Beijing or Shanghai or Paris or Abu Dhabi. It could include a small
          hotel, cinema, lecture spaces, marketing space, flexi-labs, meeting spaces, a range of video conferencing technologies, etc. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short
        <em>, what spatial-organizational strategies and practices need to be designed and implemented to enable resource constrained universities to access, embed in, and engage with global cities.</em> Please discuss with reference to actual examples and/or
        hypothetical scenarios. And if you need a kick-start, also think about last week’s discussion about models and mechanisms for globalizing universities, as well as the case studies above.</p>
