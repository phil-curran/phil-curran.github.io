        <em>Welcome!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Universities and higher education systems worldwide are being
        transformed by new and changing actors, practices, programs, policies,
        and agendas. From notions of 'global competency' and 'international
        branch campuses,' to ever more common perceptions that international
        collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the
        phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed
        and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open
        online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted
        on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the 'Knowledge
          Economy'</em
        >
        is designed to help students better understand some of these complex
        changes.
      </p>
      <h4>Our specific objectives are to:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide an integrated 'big picture' regarding the globalization of
          higher education and research.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing
          on <em>emergences</em> -- the forward edges of change -- as well as
          the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this
          tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers,
          institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and
          regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping
          agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and
          outcomes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the end, we hope to stimulate some exciting globally oriented
        learning about how key aspects of the higher education sector - from
        research to teaching, learning, and service (the 'third mission') - are
        changing. We don't have the answers, but together we're hoping that we
        can all use this MOOC to collectively learn more about this increasingly
        important topic.
      </p>
      <h4>Approach</h4>
      <p>
        We'd like to pass on some information about a few other aspects of this
        course so you know what you're getting into!
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="media-body">
          <img
            class="media-object pull-left"
            src="../_img/number-01.png"
            alt="one"
          /> </span
        >First, the design of this course is very different from most
        Coursera-based courses in that it does not rely on video lectures and
        associated quizzes. Rather, the content will be rolled out weekly via a
        4000-7000 word long text with integrated multimedia elements (audio
        interviews with experts, visualizations, photographs, select videos, and
        hyperlinks to documents, reports, articles, etc.). This approach
        reflects our assessment of what works best with respect to the topic we
        are focusing on, as well as the practical realities of jointly
        developing a course on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean six time
        zones apart. We're also excited by experiments underway in long-form
        journalism, blogging, and e-textbooks. Indeed, a Department of Geography
        (UW-Madison) student helped put together the New York Times' 'Snow Fall'
        story (see
        <a href="http://bit.ly/1eu12ZO" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1eu12ZO</a
        >) and we took select formatting ideas from the story and the subsequent
        online stories that were inspired by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="media-body">
          <img
            class="media-object pull-left"
            src="../_img/number-02.png"
            alt="two"
          /> </span
        >Second, and on a related note, the course is intended to function as a
        free and open-access resource. Therefore, all submitted material during
        weekly exercises will be automatically associated with a Creative
        Commons Attribution 4.0 license, which gives others considerable freedom
        to share submitted ideas. Students who submit work to the course's
        forums retain copyright to it, but irrevocably grant anyone permission
        to use, copy, modify, and adapt it commercially with attribution. As a
        result, the course should de facto resemble a MOOR (a Massive Open
        Online Resource) – a trading space for ideas. The goal of adopting this
        approach is to enable the MOOC/MOOR to facilitate the building of
        networks between participants, the sharing of resources, and the
        stimulation of new and needed debates about the course topic. In short,
        we encourage you to contribute, discuss, debate, borrow, reformulate,
        and help everyone build a useful MOOR! And, if things go well, we hope
        this course will serve as a model for hybrid open-closed online and
        blended courses at universities that are available both to regular
        for-credit students, but also to curious members of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="media-body">
          <img
            class="media-object pull-left"
            src="../_img/number-03.png"
            alt="three"
          /> </span
        >Third, we've attempted to, as much as possible, adopt a do-it-yourself
        (DIY) approach to the production of the MOOC. We don't believe MOOCs
        should be developed at considerable expense in the current fiscal
        context, especially in public higher education. While we've being
        assisted by two wonderful online course staff (Kevin Thompson and Phil
        Curran), we've used free or low-cost technologies to produce the
        content, we've recorded the Q&amp;A sessions ourselves (e.g., via
        Skype), we've sourced the development of the visualizations via the
        University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab (which employs students), and
        we've processed most of the files via free programs. This is, after all,
        how most faculty will need to operate in the digital era. This MOOC
        inevitably won't match the production level of some MOOCs out there, but
        it is not designed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="media-body">
          <img
            class="media-object pull-left"
            src="../_img/number-04.png"
            alt="four"
          /> </span
        >Fourth, we designed this MOOC to be relatively accessible in contexts
        associated with low levels of internet bandwidth. The presence of audio
        and the absence of video helps on this front, clearly. We've also
        designed it to be mobile device-friendly regardless of mobile platform.
        If you use an Apple iPhone or iPad, you can download the relevant
        Coursera app here:
        <a
          href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/coursera/id736535961"
          target="_blank"
          >https://itunes.apple.com/app/coursera/id736535961</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We hear that Android versions of these apps are coming soon, but they
        are unlikely to be available by the time our course is finished in May
        2014. It is our view that text vs. video enables people to better engage
        with the content at variable paces depending on your own approach to
        scrolling through text, as well as visiting the rabbit holes (aka
        hyperlinks to articles, stories, websites, and so on) we have provided.
        We're also aware most of the experimentation with MOOCs is in
        video-heavy courses, and we're keen to experiment with text, audio, and
        visualizations. Your feedback on how to improve our adopted format is
        thus very much welcomed.

        Each week will involve working through the text and multi-media elements
        associated with seven different yet linked topics (see below for titles
        and keywords). The seven weeks of material are not being transferred
        over from a previously existing course – this model has been built from
        the ground up. This said, the course structure is inspired by reactions
        to talks both of us have given to diverse non-academic and academic
        audiences (including university governing boards/councils).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the content is modularized, and you can mix-and-match weeks
        depending upon your specific interests, or else complete the entire
        course. We've designed the weeks to be stand-alone such that you can
        focus on 2-3-4-5 weeks in variable combinations. We, of course,
        sincerely hope you'll join us for all seven weeks but if you would
        rather not, or simply can't, this in no way inhibits you from learning
        and contributing. Success in this MOOC is engagement with relevant (to
        you!) sections of the course vs. start-to-finish completion.

      <p style="margin-top: 20px">
        All seven weeks of Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the
        'Knowledge Economy' are associated with dedicated discussion forum space
        where you can participate in (a) independent discussions on the topics
        of your choice, and (b) instructor-generated discussions on 2-3
        designated topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The (b) instructor-generated topics are designed to function as
        mechanisms to help you learn from others taking the course, and to
        provide you with an opportunity to earn an optional Statement of
        Accomplishment. They are also designed to help generate complementary
        content to the text that we (Kris &amp; Susan) produced. In aggregate,
        the text and multi-medial elements we provide, plus your contributions
        to (a) and (b), are designed to help turn this MOOC into a MOOR.
      </p>
      <h4>How will this all work in practice?</h4>

        </div>
        <div class="span11">
          <p>
            First, once you have finished engaging with the text and associated
            multi-media elements, you will see 2-3 discussion forum options at
            the bottom of the text. Some of these will be framed as discussion
            questions, some as debate topics, some as requests to create
            visualizations, some as calls for a crowd-sourced critique or
            honorary nominations, some as 'blue sky' visioning exercises. Choose
            one or more discussion topic options to respond to. Please note that
            you need to contribute to at least four of the seven weekly
            discussion forums to be awarded a Statement of Accomplishment.

          complex topics where grading is required. 400 words works out to be
          about one single-spaced page.

        illuminating entries, and comment on them if you feel the urge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posting, commenting, and up-voting are <em> strongly encouraged</em> as

        posting entries on the topics of your choice are what bring open online
        courses like this one to life. It's worth noting that this approach to
        engagement and assessment reflects our awareness that many of you are
        involved with the higher education sector in one way or another, and
        that you've got busy schedules where synchronous engagement is
        difficult, if not impossible. Given this, we wanted to create
        <em>engaging spaces for partially coordinated dialogue and debate</em>.

        Many participants in the course may not be seeking any formal
        recognition, and we welcome you to participate in as many different
        activities as interests you. The course will consist of seven weekly
        activities. Guidelines for completing the weekly activities are provided
        at the end of each text and within the Syllabus tab / Activities section
        (particularly item #2, see "If you are aiming for a Statement of
        Accomplishment" above).

      <h4>
        <strong>Deadlines</strong>

      <p>
        We encourage you to participate in the activities during the week in
        which they are assigned, which starts each Monday at 10:00 AM
        (CDT/Chicago-time) and goes for one week.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest that you can submit an activity for credit is two weeks (14
        days) after the start of the week in which it is assigned.
        <em>For example:</em> the Week 1 Activity is assigned at the start of
        the week (10:00 AM CDT/Chicago-time on Monday 24 March). It is due 14
        days later (by 10:00 AM CDT/Chicago-time on Monday 7 April). Submissions
        made after the deadline, while welcome, are not eligible for credit
        towards the Statement of Accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We genuinely look forward to engaging with you – to sharing ideas,
        building networks, and learning along the way!

      <hr />
      <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
      <p>
        As the syllabus notes, we have designed this course to be a resource for
        all. The more openly and freely ideas are exchanged in the discussion
        forums, the better our collaborative learning will be. However, this
        does NOT mean there are no rules, or that anything at all goes. In fact,
        the course’s openness makes the proper attribution of information all
        the more important! On the topic of plagiarism, we expect you to abide
        by the same standards in this online course as you would at a
        bricks-and-mortar university.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plagiarism is a serious offense against the academic integrity we expect
        of course participants. It is unethical to pass off others’ work as your
        own, and actively destructive of the environment we hope to foster in
        the discussion forums. It’s worth taking a look at the formal University
        of Wisconsin-Madison
        <a
          href="http://students.wisc.edu/doso/acadintegrity.html"
          target="_blank"
          >Academic Integrity Statement</a
        >, which includes this section:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="font-size: 14px">
          All members of the University community play a role in fostering an
          environment in which student learning is achieved in a fair, just and
          honest way. Faculty and instructional staff set the tone in their
          classrooms by communicating clear expectations to their students and
          educating them on the consequences of engaging in academic misconduct
          while referring to campus resources. Students are expected to uphold
          the core values of academic integrity which include honesty, trust,
          fairness, respect and responsibility. These core values, combined with
          finding one's purpose and passion and applying them in and out of
          classroom learning, produce students who become extraordinary
          citizens.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        We expect to see the spirit of this statement reflected in student
        contributions to this course, including all posted material associated
        with the Statement of Accomplishment.

      <h4>Image &amp; Visualization Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        The sharing of pictures, images, maps, infographics and other visual
        objects is central to this course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visualizations can be drawn on the back of a restaurant napkin, a piece
        of paper, a chalkboard, or a dry erase board. Photographs of these
        visualizations can be uploaded to the discussion forum.
      </p>
      <p>

        By their nature, the number of participants in a given Massive Open
        Online Course makes direct communication from instructor to individual
        student very challenging. To mitigate this, discussion boards are often
        used to enable students to communicate with one another, as well as
        instructors and support staff to communicate to students.

      <h4>Response Times</h4>
      <p>
        The course staff and instructors will make their best effort to respond
        to pertinent questions and concerns that are content related in the
        discussion forums within a 48 hour period. However, their preliminary
        role will be as moderators to the discussion - observing, focusing and
        channeling the discussion, rather than leading it. Please rely on your
        peers to answer questions, and collectively guide one another through
        the content.

            Kris' current research focuses on the globalization of higher
            education and research. This research agenda relates to his
            longstanding research interests in the globalization of the services
            industries (including higher education, architecture, property), and
            their relationship to urban and regional change. He makes heavy use
            of digital outlets to engage, serve, and engender informed debate

            Susan L. Robertson is Professor, Sociology of Education, Graduate
            School of Education, University of Bristol, UK. She is also Director
            of the University of Bristol's Centre for Globalisation, Education

            and Education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Professor Robertson's research focuses on the political economy of
            the education sector, and how education is the object and outcome of
            converging and diverging policies and practices around the globe.
            These include creating education as a services sector, the
            commercialisation of education, and the increased role of for-profit
            actors in the sector. An important aspect of this transformation has
            been the growth of international agencies and transnational firms in
            shaping these processes.

        This course is designed as a resource for helping us all better
        understand how the globalization of higher education and research is
        unfolding. The more people have access to what we produce here together,
        the more powerful this resource will be. Therefore, we have elected to
        make the products of this course—what we provide, as well as what you
        create—shareable. Please think carefully about what this means before
        you participate.

            <br />A: Students who successfully complete the course requirements
            specified are eligible to receive a Statement of Accomplishment. You
            can still participate, though, even if you don't seek a Statement of

            >
            <br />A: The course is intended to function as a free and
            open-access resource. Therefore, all submitted material during
            weekly exercises will be automatically associated with a Creative
            Commons Attribution 4.0 license, which gives others considerable
            freedom to share submitted ideas. Students who submit work to the
            course's forums retain copyright to it, but irrevocably grant anyone
            permission to use, copy, modify, and adapt it commercially with
            attribution. As a result, the course should de facto resemble a MOOR
            (a Massive Open Online Resource) – a trading space for ideas. The
            goal of adopting this approach is to enable the MOOC/MOOR to
            facilitate the building of networks between participants, the
            sharing of resources, and the stimulation of new and needed debates
            about the course topic.

            </strong>
            <br />A: As stated above, to keep with the spirit of this approach,
            instructor provided course materials can be downloaded off the
            course site in PDF format. The same open access principles,
            including attribution if used, apply.

              >Q: The course has already started – is it too late to
              join?</strong
            >
            <br />A: The course can be joined at any time (even during Week 7!).
            Each week’s material, while rolled out, will be available for
            approximately two months after the course ends (in early May). As
            noted in the syllabus, if you are seeking a Statement of
            Accomplishment, you must complete at least four of the seven weekly
            activities by the respective assignment deadlines – late joiners can
            just focus on the latter four weekly activities if they are keen to
            acquire an official Statement, though we recommend that you keep
            track of the deadlines for submitting exercise responses.
