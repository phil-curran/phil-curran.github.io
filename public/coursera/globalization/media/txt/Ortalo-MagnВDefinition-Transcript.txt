>> Hello Francois.  How would you define global competency?  

[00:00:05]
>> I think of global competency as an appreciation for the diversity of the human race.  People who possess global competency have communication skills that enable them to bridge the cultural differences and overcome the limitations of our languages.  I think they also have the leadership abilities to build collaborative human relationships and draw out great synergies.
