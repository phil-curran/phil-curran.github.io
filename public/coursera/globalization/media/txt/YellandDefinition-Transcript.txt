>> I'm Richard Yelland.  I've been working at the OECD, the Organization For Economic Corporation Development for far longer than I like to think.  I hesitate to pronounce on global competencies, and this would certainly be a personal view and one which is very much colored by having three children who are now either at the early stages of their careers or looking to be.  For me, the most important thing is to have an understanding that other cultures can do things in different ways.  Languages are one, living in more than one country is an extremely important part of that.

There is also room for the people who are the team builders, the communicators, the federators.
