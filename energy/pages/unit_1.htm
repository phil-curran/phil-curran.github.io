<p class="lead">Our focus: how fossil fuel use has radically transformed human existence.</p>
<p>We'll explore the history of carbon as the building block of our energy foundations, climate change on our planet throughout the past 20,000 years, the evolution of our energy use, and your personal impact on global energy consumption. </p>
<h4>What will be covered</h4>
<p>After this unit, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the three enduring ideas that govern all energy use.</li>
<li>Explain the basic origin of fossil fuels.</li>
<li>Summarize how energy use has influenced the global climate system.</li>
<li>Summarize how the use of high-quality energy resources has grown over the past century.</li>
<li>Evaluate your own personal energy use and its impact in terms of greenhouse emissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fossil fuels have brought unprecedented changes to human lifestyles, but the associated release of greenhouse gases currently threatens the sustainability of these changes. Energy use and its consequences therefore drive some of the most important policy debates of our time. This excerpt from the book "Geofuels: Energy and the Energy" summarizes some of the key elements of these debates.</p>

            <td>Our energy foundations are built of carbon, which is used by plants to chemically store the energy of the Sun. This storage capacity provides tremendous practical leverage, because solar energy accumulated over months to millions of years can be utilized in minutes. However, carbon dioxide also acts as an atmospheric thermostat that regulates the Earth’s temperature. Carbon burial in the Earth’s crust generally cools the Earth, whereas the return of carbon to the atmosphere causes warming.</td>

            <td>Over the past 20,000 years the face of the Earth has changed dramatically, due to the retreat of continental-scale ice sheets from the northern hemisphere. This natural warming period, which spanned nearly 10,000 years, set the stage for modern human civilization. Combustion of fossil fuels is expected to produce the same amount of warming over a period of only 300 years, threatening our future.</td>

Other energy sources have made steady but modest inroads over that time, growing from 6% of  primary energy consumption in 1965 to only 14% today. However, global energy use is really just the aggregation of individual energy use, suggesting that we can personally have an impact. To do so requires recognizing the true magnitude of own energy use, and considering different options to reduce it.</td>

            <td>In order for atmospheric temperatures to remain stable, the solar energy absorbed by the Earth and by greenhouse gases must be balanced by an equal amount of infrared radiation (heat) escaping back to space.  The rate at which heat escapes to space is controlled by temperature; a hotter atmosphere radiates heat more quickly. Increased greenhouse gas concentrations therefore result in higher atmospheric temperatures, in order to maintain the balance with incoming solar energy.</td>
