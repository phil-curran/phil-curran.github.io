<h3>Fermentation In A Bag</h3>
<p>Current generation biofuels consist primarily of ethanol, which is mixed in varying proportions with gasoline (petrol) in transportation fuels. The basic technology for making ethanol is among the oldest known to humans, who started making alcoholic beverages prior to recorded history. Alcohol is produced by fermentation, a complex chemical process that can be summarized by the following simplified reaction:</p>
<p><i>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (sugar) + yeast → 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (ethanol) + 2 CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide)</i></p>
<p>The yeast provide an enzyme that allows fermentation to occur. Note that that carbon dioxide is produced in direct proportion to ethanol. This means that you can measure the amount of alcohol being produced by the amount of carbon dioxide gas that is generated.</p>
<p>In principle, just about any type of plant matter can be used as a feedstock for fermentation, including not only sugars but also cellulose. Cellulose is an organic polymer that contains many sugar molecules linked together in long chains. It is a principle constituent of materials such as wood, cotton, and grasses. Technologies for making ethanol from cellulose were first demonstrated over a century ago, but have yet to be commercialized on a large scale.</p>
<p>The following experiment is intended to provide some insight into how current generation biofuels are made, and also into the challenges involved in next-generation cellulosic ethanol production.</p>
<h4>Materials required:</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 small resealable zipper bag (snack size)</li>
<li>5 ml (1 teaspoon) of table sugar (sucrose)</li>
<li>5 ml (1 teaspoon) of dry active yeast (must be fresh)</li>
<li>50 ml (1/4 cup) warm water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Procedure - Part 1</h4>
<ol>
<li>Combine the sugar yeast inside the plastic bag.</li>
<li>Add the warm water and zip the bag closed, carefully squeezing out as much of air as possible.</li>
<li>Mix gently.</li>
<li>Lay bag on a warm, flat surface (if you do not have a suitable surface, you can place the bag in a shallow pan filled with warm water).  </li>
<li>Watch for results over the next 1-2 hours (Note:  you should start seeing results within 15 minutes).</li>
<li>Note what happens. Bubbles of carbon dioxide should begin to appear inside the bag.<br><br>
<blockquote><i>Warning:</i> As the yeast produce carbon dioxide, the bag will expand – it may even pop! Be sure to monitor the bag and release the gas if becomes too inflated.</blockquote></li>
<li>Congratulations! You have now made your own biofuel.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Procedure - Part 2</h4>
<ol>
<li>Repeat the above experiment, substituting a different feedstock in place of sugar. Alternate feedstocks could include just about any kind of plant-derived material, such as corn meal, sawdust, grass clippings, etc.</li>
<li>Note the results – how do the results using alternate feedstocks compare to the first experiment that used sugar as a feedstock?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
<p>Based on what you have learned, respond to one (or both) of the following questions in the <a href=" "><strong>Unit 3 Discussion Forum</strong></a>. (You can click either of the questions to go directly to it in the discussion board.)</p>
<p><strong><a href=" ">1. What do you see as the principal advantages and disadvantages of biofuels, compared to other alternatives?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=" ">2. How would the development of cellulosic biofuels influence the balance of advantages and disadvantages of biofuels?</a></strong></p></div>
