<p class="lead">Our focus: how using fossil fuels taps into our geologic savings account, which has accrued energy over a period of 500 million years.</p>
<h4>What will be covered</h4>
<p>At the conclusion of this unit, you will be able describe the major categories of fossil fuels, and how their use has evolved since the 19th century, and the implications of these changes.  You will also be able to describe the basic process of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”), and discuss its implications for future energy supplies and for the environment.</p>
<p>After this unit, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare fossil fuel abundance to solar flux during the time they accumulated.</li>
<li>Explain how 21st century fossil fuel resources differ from the fossil fuels of the 19th and 20th centuries.</li>
<li>Describe the basic process of fracking, and discuss its implications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where do fossil fuels really come from? Put simply, coal, oil, and natural gas represent solar energy that was originally trapped by plants and stored in the Earth’s crust. Fossil fuels can be roughly subdivided according to whether they originated from land plants, such as trees, herbs, and grasses, or aquatic plants, primarily one-celled algae.</p>
<p>This  excerpt from the book "Geofuels: Energy and the Energy" examines the origins of the major fossil fuel groups, and compares the Earth to a very large natural solar collector.</p>

<h4>Optional reading:</h4>
<p>The advent of hydraulic fracturing technology has resulted in a marked upswing in drilling activity in many regions, leading to a vigorous debate over its local economic and environmental impact. The impact of fracking extends beyond the areas being actively drilled, however, and can even affect regions that possess no fossil fuel resources of their own. One such area is the state of Wisconsin, which is located in a region of the U.S. that generally lacks deposits of coal, crude, oil, or natural gas. Wisconsin does possess extensive deposits of quartz sandstone however, which have proven vital to supporting the fracking industry. Due to its physical characteristics and the ease with which it can be mined, Wisconsin sand is highly sought-after as proppant: the material that props open hydraulic fractures during oil and gas production.</p>
<p>The following reading/slideset examines the geology and mining of Wisconsin frac sand, along with the impacts of its use. While this topic is of special interest to those living in Wisconsin, the broader impacts of fracking should be of interest to all.</p>

They are widespread and relatively easy to find, but difficult to extract due to the low-permeability of the rocks that contain them. Horizontal drill and hydraulic fracturing make extraction possible by reducing the distance that unconventional oil and gas must flow through the subsurface.</td>

Deep underground injection of waste water has also been shown to cause earthquakes in a some areas.  </td>

            <td>Hydraulic fracturing has dramatically boosted the production of oil and gas in the U.S., and will likely do the same in other parts of the world. Its full potential has yet to be realized. The techniques used to optimize production and protect the environment have changed continuously, and will likely continue to do so. As with conventional oil and gas development, adequate regulation is important for limiting potential environmental problems.</td>
