[00:00:04]
>> Hi.  How are you?  What is global competency?  

[00:00:10]
>> I think it's two main things.  First thing is that we can now understand, in a way that previous generations wouldn't have been able to, that most of the big questions that we face are actually questions which span the whole, almost, of the globe.  And -- but that means that universities are necessarily involved at a larger scale than perhaps they were in the past.  Then, secondly, I think it's the case that students and staff increasingly have to manifest global competency in that they have to manage careers which move across continents and, at the same time, involve them creating the kind of globe which does move across continents.
