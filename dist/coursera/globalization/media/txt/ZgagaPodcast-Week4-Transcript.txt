Production Transcript for Pavel Zgaga Q&A.mp3




[00:00:01]
>> Pavel, fantastic that you could actually talk to us and to talk to all of the participants taking the MOOC.  And what we've been getting our head around are new regionalizing projects that involve higher education.  And the one that you've been very deeply involved in is the Bologna Process that begins in 1999, but actually it has its genesis in an agreement or a declaration in 1998 actually, the celebration of 800 years of the Sorbonne.  

[00:00:35]
>> Yeah.  

[00:00:35]
>> But I'm wondering, can we start with this first question then, of, what in your view was the single most important dynamic that the Sorbonne -- and later the Bologna Process -- was attempting to solve?  

[00:00:49]
>> Yeah, I think I have to look to start answering your question from today's point of view.  What I mean, the picture which we saw 15 years ago, I guess, was quite different from the picture we have today.  So from today's point of view, I think that the Bologna Process with its beginning had to solve a rather a simple problem.  It didn't seem so simple at that time, but from today's point of view, definitely.  This was how to remove obstacles to deeper cooperation between European national higher education systems, how to remove obstacles that were set by various national and academic regulation practice -- I think this was the most important point.  We should not forget, of course, that this happened just a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which expanded the symbolic dimension of Europe greatly, but it also increased the European diversities.  
[00:02:02]
Europe was -- after the Berlin Wall -- much, much more different than before.  On the other hand, this -- the birth of Bologna happened also during the period when the old part of the united Europe, of the European Union, faced with the danger of gradual lagging behind some other fast-developing regions of the world, I think this is also important.  Altogether, this means that the response to this challenge was an inherent part of solving the problem addressed by the Bologna Process.  However, if I may continue, I would say in the further development of the Bologna Process, the problem, the problem addressed became more complex as well as more ambitious, ambitious as a result of the initial success.  
[00:03:03]
More and more issues were added to the Bologna agenda, and this started to create some hurdles at certain points.  For example, all items on the agenda are not of equal importance for all countries involved.  For example, old EU countries, new EU countries, non-EU countries, this is -- the agendas from these countries can be quite, quite diverse.  Also a number of action lines -- Bologna action lines -- are in potential collision one with another.  For example, higher education is a public good on one hand, and higher education is an economy lever on the other.  Or if you wish, differentiation between higher education as competition or cooperation, and the like.  

[00:04:01]
>> Yes, and at that point essentially, if we're looking at that time -- as you rightly point out -- 15 years or so ago -- I mean, where was that competition in terms of higher education and what was that competition about?  

[00:04:15]
>> You mean at the beginning?  

[00:04:16]
>> Yes.  

[00:04:17]
>> I think that competition at the beginning was not a term used within the intra-European discourses.  The competition appeared in these early stages of the Bologna Process, but rather in addressing the other regions of the world.  

[00:04:40]
>> So in this case, is it the U.S. and, you know, a concern about...  

[00:04:43]
>> Exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was in between the general, the East Asia, Southeast, and so on.  

[00:04:49]
>> Sure, yeah.  

[00:04:50]
>> I think that originally, I don't remember that competition was launched as an intra-European issue.  However, it entered later.  

[00:05:06]
>> Because the world is also changing, isn't it?  If we think of the dot-com bubble in 2002, 2003, and that collapsed in a more distinctive sense of urgency, I think, particularly in Europe about, on what basis are we going to, kind of, think about higher education and its relationship to the economy in the future across Europe?  

[00:05:28]
>> Of course, of course.  Definitely so, I mean, circumstances in which the Bologna Process was set up have greatly changed until today.  And this means that also the Bologna Process itself has had its ups and downs, if you wish.  So what it is today, it is not responding to the same problem and the same issues as they were 15 years ago.  

[00:06:02]
>> Now, you mentioned when we began, you know, dealing with obstacles and were these, kind of, the logical outcomes in terms of obstacles, of things like the Erasmus Program that encouraged students to be mobile, but then -- and this idea that they could do credits elsewhere -- but the mechanisms that would enable those formal, kind of, transfers to take place were not there?  

[00:06:29]
>> Yeah, well, Erasmus, ECTS and similar questions, I still think that these are mainly technical issues in this discussion, in this development.  And basically European countries involved in early Erasmus were actually obliged -- it was necessary -- to invent, like you say, some technical tools to strengthen their cooperation.  However, I think that it is more important to draw on the content side of the issue and not to the tools themselves.  So it is not so much about tools, but about ends.  And here, there was a very, very fruitful and also hot discussion over the first five, seven years of the Bologna Process.  

[00:07:31]
>> Can I raise the question -- or not so much a question -- but: Cliff Adelman, who's a United States commentator on higher education, and he describes the Bologna Process, as others have, as being such a success that it left him somewhat breathless.  And I think by any measure, if we look at the Bologna Process, that extraordinarily it's been a success.  I mean, in those terms, Pavel, I'm wondering what your thoughts are as being someone so centrally involved in the Bologna Process through all of its early years and even today. What's the cause of this success?  Because one could imagine 47 countries now, how is it that -- you know, even we find it very difficult to get two institutions to talk together?  This is 47 countries and all their institutions.  What's the cause of this success?  

[00:08:30]
>> Yeah, yeah, the Bologna success can be measured, in my views, primarily by how such a large group of countries -- diverse countries -- succeeded in a relatively short period of time to agree on such fundamental issues.  

[00:08:49]
>> And how did they do that?  

[00:08:51]
>> Well, my opinion is that this success should be connected with enthusiasm about the new, bigger, more united Europe, which characterized the '90s; the l'esprit du temps of that time.  I mean, joint participation in the reform of higher education systems and then the globalization of that time were for many countries -- especially medium-sized and small countries -- an empowering strategy.  Given the skepticism that this tide is spreading across Europe, we are now faced with threats to the...  success achieved, I would say.  

[00:09:35]
>> Because in -- academics are quite enthusiastic, aren't they, about working with each other across Europe.  

[00:09:41]
>> Oh definitely.  Definitely.  

[00:09:43]
>> Despite the issues.  But Bologna must come at a cost, and I'm wondering in what way Bologna then -- as a process -- reduces national and institutional autonomy over its sector.  Is that the case?  Is there a reduction in autonomy and, I mean, are there positive consequences of the reduction of that autonomy and are there negative consequences?  

[00:10:10]
>> It's really not easy to answer your question.  I mean, either the answer is yes and no.  On one hand, it should be of course noted that documents of the Bologna Process, I mean, in various declarations, communiques and so on, poses only a character of recommendations, this is even not soft law; it is less than that.  The process has not led to any binding legal documents, so far as we know.  However, representatives of European universities and colleges and, for example, student organizations, also have had important role in the drafting process for these documents.  It means -- so it is not just something from above.  For their own recommendations of the Bologna Process are implemented at national and institution level, not at European.  
[00:11:12]
It is quite possible, and until today there has been a lot of evidence about it, that these countries and universities implement recommendations in accordance with their own interpretations.  Then this leads, or this may lead, to differences between countries and institutions.  So this is not much about taking autonomy and sovereignty away; however, I would say, in this perspective, the national sovereignty and institutional autonomy is preserved.  But on the other hand, it can't be ignored that there is, let's say, an ideological effect of the process.  In 10 or 15 years, a series of beliefs and ways of approaching higher education issues...  have been leading to uniform solutions.  
[00:12:16]
More and more, people believe that there are certain solutions which can't be questioned or disputed anymore.  Originally, for example, the Bologna Process advocated unity of diversity, obviously that this unity of diversity is rather another problem than a solution in the context of European integration.  In particular, the current time is particular evidence of this aspect.  So this is perhaps that side where we can, we can say that both the sovereignty on the national level, the policy development, legislation and so on, as well as autonomy on the institution level, may be put under a question mark.  

[00:13:05]
>> So does, so we have this kind of paradoxical perhaps convergence at the same --  

[00:13:11]
>> Yes, indeed.  

[00:13:12]
>> Yes, at the same time as to some extent actually possibly competitiveness is tied to diversity, which might be an interesting thing to think about.  Perhaps I could raise this question about equity of outcomes; it's something that you've raised and maybe it's understated, I think, in many of the debates, that actually Bologna, when it's applied to education systems, and I'm thinking of countries like Germany, which had quite extended undergraduate periods of study, but that essentially means you have much smaller numbers of students going to university, Bologna opens up the window of equity.  Would that be a true statement to make?  

[00:13:57]
>> Oh, yes.  Yeah, yeah, I agree with that, yeah.  The process has led to a strong student involvement in discussions about what kind of higher education we want to have.  This is the first point which I would like to make here.  Actually, as much as we remember, in fact, students have managed to negotiate this stride very well, without being invited in 1999 to the first conference.  They came to Bologna and claimed to be involved.  

[00:14:33]
>> Yes.  

[00:14:34]
>> Yeah, they knocked the door and ministers and directors only had to open the door.  In subsequent years, the role of students -- or student organizations -- strengthened in almost all national systems.  And this was quite a surprise in particular in most, more old-fashioned systems.  How to allow students to sit in a room and to discuss the organization of modern university; this was a shock for many, many professors.  It was not a shock only on the political.  On the other hand, of course, we can't ignore that the ongoing discussions on the social dimension of the Bologna Process.  I think that this is quite a vague term, “social dimension”, but this term has been invented by the Bologna Process, or within the Bologna Process.  This was mainly, as much as I remember, the pressure from the ESIB, the former student organization today ESU, starting somewhere in 2001, 2003.  
[00:15:39]
So parallel to the -- let me say -- growing neoliberal discourse, also within Bologna Process, students brought in another debate.  A debate on equity, a debate on social energy, we should not ignore these issues.  And this discussion is ongoing.  So I think from that point of view, this is — once I said that I don't understand the Bologna Process as a clear-cut policy arc.  It is rather apparent where different views and different discourses -- perhaps not all that should be there -- but different discourses compete one with another.  And a discussion on social dimension, it is a discussion on equity in higher education, which is a very, very important part of today's overall discussion, not only about higher education, but about European societies on the other side.  

[00:16:41]
>> And indeed actually, I'm just thinking as you're talking, that some of the students, Pavel, that we're working with, for instance, Benya, but also one of your former students/colleagues, Manya...  

[00:16:55]
>> Sure, sure.  They can tell you a lot more.  

[00:16:57]
>> Yes.  They've written very interesting pieces of work, which might be worthwhile for some of the MOOC participants to follow up, if they were so interested.  

[00:17:06]
>> Absolutely.  

[00:17:08]
>> But can I focus now on something you've also written about, which is the, kind of, these echoes of Bologna?  So other parts of the world become quite interested in this phenomenal success of Bologna by any measure.  And we have Latin America that becomes interested in certain instruments like tuning, and it becomes Tuning America Latina.  And most recently, I might add, Macquarie University in Australia has branded itself with a Bologna brand.  These are phenomenal successes, at one level, of Bologna globalizing.  Was it the intention of any of the Bologna Process members to globalize, or it just seemed to kind of go viral, if we would want to use an Internet term?  

[00:18:03]
>> I think that the, yeah, one of the earliest turns we did in the Bologna Process was the external dimension.  And it appeared later on.  I think that originally this was not part, this was not a point on the agenda.  Originally the point of the agenda was, and particularly from strong countries -- strong higher education systems -- as those four who were presented at the Sorbonne meeting in 1998: France, Italy, Germany and the UK.  This was perhaps a question of how to respond to the challenge of North America, or Australia in higher education, global higher education.  However, this particular debate on the external dimension, as much as I remember, this term appeared around 2003 only.  This is something else.  
[00:19:04]
This was perhaps partly also a kind of surprise within the Bologna Process.  "Look!  People in other world regions are looking to us.  They’re interested in what we are doing.  Isn't it great?  And what does it mean?"  So these were the questions.  Actually, my answer would be that Bologna is not a response only to European problems.  One part of the European problem is for sure a global problem, and it is well known in other countries, in other regions of the world.  It is discussed at universities in these parts of the world, as you just mentioned.  The global dimension of modernization of universities is to me normal and will continue to be addressed.  Of course, it will continue either with some success, or with creating some new problems.  It is very difficult to forecast.  

[00:20:08]
>> So it becomes potentially a model to solve similar kinds of problems, thinking actually of MERCOSUR that the, our students will be looking at, and more recent in the Latin American context...  

[00:20:25]
>> Yeah, yeah.  

[00:20:26]
>> ...instrument or regional projects like UNISA, but I focus on MERCOSUR.  MERCOSUR for example has now picked up this idea of every national setting, country has to have qualifications, qualifications, frameworks, which they have not had actually; interestingly Chile, which is now part of MERCOSUR Plus.  So Bologna actually enables these countries to think about what could be feasible in terms of the reform of their education systems.  Would that be how -- and again, similar kinds of problems to do with, not just quality, but quality assurance mechanisms and so on?  

[00:21:12]
>> Of course.  We have here a number of issues, which we should discuss in this global context.  From the, but the policy level, I think that many regions in the world need to address particular issues in their particular context.  And here I mean they can find some parallels with what happened in Europe.  If you discuss cooperation among policymakers in Latin America, or in Southeast Asia, or, and so on.  So these are lessons which can be learned from the European case, with its success as well as with its failure, I should say here.  On the other hand, of course, this, let me say, global cooperation or global attractiveness of the Bologna is perhaps in particular interesting within the university sector.  
[00:22:21]
We know that the word "university" has just nothing to do with “universe”.  Nevertheless, universities all over the world face a number of similar -- if not the same -- issues, like for example: we are now in the, at the mass or universal level of access to higher education, but most of our universities still use methods of teaching, learning and assessment, which belong to the elite period of higher education.  So this is one of the issues why tuning project, for example, has taken such a wide echo all over the world, because within tuning we started to discuss these particular issues.  How to, can we make certain innovations in teaching and learning?  
[00:23:24]
Can we make it more fit to the requests of today's universities?  And so on.  

[00:23:30]
>> Sure.  

[00:23:31]
>> So it is exciting that this is just part of a normal problem; 200 years ago with maybe, I don't know, 500 universities all over the world, this discussion took place in a little bit different context, and now with thousands and thousands of universities we need to find a new way to respond to these problems today.  

[00:23:55]
>> The other element I noticed that is prominent in other forms of regional integration using higher education is student mobility.  We can see this in the Southeast Asian regionalisms that are emerging.  

[00:24:10]
>> Sure.  Yeah.  

[00:24:11]
>> Ways of actually helping students develop their competences -- global competences -- potentially, through having them spend periods of time in another country and another institution and so on.  Pavel, I'm wondering if I could ask you to kind of think forward in 10 years' time, and try and imagine — and maybe this is speculative, and maybe this is a kind of realistic, kind of utopian vision — but how would you like, how would you imagine higher education in Europe will look in 10 years' time?  

[00:24:45]
>> I always hesitate about this kind of question, Susan.  Why?  Because if I'm serious, I'm sure that the debate about the future is always a debate about alternatives.  It's not possible to eliminate certain scenarios and to keep with only one.  For that reason, I would say that higher education in Europe 2020 will be either at a significantly higher level, or maybe not.  As we now see, the black scenario may run in the direction in which Europe will split into higher education centers and higher education territories.  But of course, it is not necessary, there is also -- at least on paper -- a scenario which can perhaps draw towards strengthening our national higher education systems, but in cooperation with one with another.  
[00:25:53]
So I am quite, quite, it is quite difficult to be, to say what kind of higher education I can expect in 2020.  This would be perhaps more my very, very subjective view than anything else.  

[00:26:10]
>> Sure.  And much of that would be dependent on what the next few years actually begin to look like in terms of European regional integration and so on.  

[00:26:21]
>> Absolutely.  Absolutely, absolutely.  When we discuss European higher education, then the most important single factor is what way the European integration process will take next years.  Today, that is quite a, quite a hot issue.  

[00:26:43]
>> Sure.  So Pavel can I thank you very, very much for really focusing our attention on some very interesting elements of the politics and possibilities, I think, that the Bologna Process has released?  So again, Pavel, thank you so much for your time.  

[00:27:04]
>> Thank you, Susan, for giving me this opportunity.  

[00:27:06]
>> Thank you.
